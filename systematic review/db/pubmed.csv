1,0,27530914,Association between cannabis use and treatment outcomes in patients receiving methadone maintenance treatment: a systematic review protocol.,"BACKGROUND: With the non-medical use of prescription opioids increasingly becoming a method of abuse in Canada, the number of patients requiring methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) for opioid use disorder has increased dramatically. The rate of cannabis use in this population is disproportionately high (~50 %). Because its use is generally perceived as harmless, cannabis use is often not monitored during MMT. Current literature regarding the effects of cannabis use on MMT is conflicting, and the presence and nature of an association has not been clearly established. The primary objective of this review will be to conduct a systematic review of the literature and, if appropriate, a meta-analysis to determine whether there is an association between cannabis use and MMT outcomes. A secondary objective will be to perform subgroup analyses (by age, sex, method of cannabis measurement, and country) to determine whether cannabis use differentially influences MMT outcomes within these subgroups.DESIGN: The search will be conducted on the following electronic databases using a predefined search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Two authors (LZ and MB) will independently screen articles using predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria and will extract data from included articles using a pilot-tested data extraction form. Disagreements at all stages of the screening process will be settled through discussion, and when consensus cannot be reached, a third author (ZS) will be consulted. An assessment of quality and risk of bias will be conducted on all included articles, and a sensitivity analysis will be used to compare results of studies with high and low risk of bias. We will perform random- and fixed-effects meta-analyses, if appropriate, with heterogeneity calculated using the I (2) statistic and formal evaluation of publication bias.DISCUSSION: Results of this systematic review will elucidate the association between cannabis use and methadone maintenance treatment outcomes. We will provide evidence that will be useful to clinicians regarding whether monitoring cannabis use during MMT is advantageous for optimizing MMT outcomes.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42015029372.","MiNDS Neuroscience Graduate Program, McMaster University, 1280 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON, L8S 4L8, Canada.",2016,10.1186/s13643-016-0317-2
2,,27254289,Diagnosis and Treatment of Alcoholic Hepatitis: A Systematic Review.,"Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs in about one-third of individuals reporting long-term heavy alcohol use. It is associated with high short-term mortality, economic burden, and hospital resources utilization. We performed this systematic review to (i) describe clinical characteristics and genomics associated with the risk of AH; (ii) discuss role and limitations of liver biopsy and prognostic scoring systems; (iii) summarize evidence regarding the currently available therapies including liver transplantation; and (iv) outline emerging therapies with areas of unmet need. Literature search was performed for studies published in English language (January 1971 through March 2016). The following search engines were used: PubMed, Elsevier Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. For the treatment section, only randomized controlled studies were included for this review. A total of 138 studies (59 randomized, 22 systematic reviews or meta-analyses, 7 surveys or guidelines, 7 population-based, and 43 prospective cohorts) were cited. There are over 325,000 annual admissions with AH contributing to about 0.8% of all hospitalizations in the United States. Liver biopsy may be required in about 25 to 30% cases for uncertain clinical diagnosis. Corticosteroids with or without N-acetylcysteine remains the only available therapy for severe episodes. Data are emerging on the role of liver transplantation as salvage therapy for select patients. Abstinence remains the most important factor impacting long-term prognosis. Results from the ongoing clinical trials within the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-funded consortia are awaited for more effective and safer therapies. AH is a potentially lethal condition with a significant short-term mortality. A high index of suspicion is required. There remains an unmet need for noninvasive biomarkers for the diagnosis, and predicting prognosis and response to therapy.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.",2016,10.1111/acer.13108
3,,27228523,"What Is the Prevalence of Symptomatic Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in Chronic Spinal Pain Patients? An Assessment of the Correlation of OSAS with Chronic Opioid Therapy, Obesity, and Smoking.","BACKGROUND: In modern medicine, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a commonly described sleep disorder with airway obstruction, disrupted sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Since its description in 1976 by Guilleminault et al, numerous epidemiologic studies and systematic reviews, with multiple comorbidities related to cardiovascular sequelae, altered cognitive function, and multiple other potential complications have been described. Multiple risk factors have been identified included obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other factors. Chronic pain and chronic opioid therapy also have been described to contribute to a large proportion of patients with OSAS. Chronic pain, obesity, smoking, and chronic opioid therapy are often found together, yet there is a paucity of literature describing OSAS in chronic pain patients.OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of symptomatic OSAS in chronic spinal pain patients receiving chronic opioid therapy and determine the association of OSAS with multiple risk factors and comorbidities.STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective assessment of patients who attend a single interventional pain management practice from January 1, 2010to December 31, 2014.SETTING: A private interventional pain management practice in the United States.METHODS: The data were collected from 4,036 consecutive patients presenting for assessment to a pain management center from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. All assessments were comprehensive and performed by 2 physicians. The comprehensive assessment included a complete history, a physical examination, and a review of records.RESULTS: The prevalence of OSAS in patients with chronic spinal pain was 13.8%. The results showed a higher prevalence in males compared to females (15.1% versus 12.8%), a higher prevalence in those aged 45 or older compared to those 25-45 years and those 18-25 years (16.3% versus 10.7% or 2.5%), higher prevalence in Hispanics and Asians compared to African Americans and whites (23.7% versus 16.2% versus 13.4%), higher prevalence in patients with combined back and neck pain compared to patients with thoracic pain only or back pain only (16.3% versus 8.2% to 11%). Prevalence also varied by body mass index (BMI): 32.4% in morbidly obese patients, 20.3% in severely obese patients, 15.7% in obese patients, 9.2% in those who were overweight, and only 5.7% in those with normal weight. A significant correlation with OSAS was also observed in patients smoking more than 40 pack years and multiple respiratory symptoms except for chronic bronchitis and multiple cardiovascular ailments.LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the assessment.CONCLUSION: This retrospective assessment of over 4,000 patients suffering from chronic pain and receiving chronic opioid therapy indicated a prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome as 13.8%. Multiple risk factors including obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic sinus and nasal discharge, and multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular and related ailments have been identified.KEY WORDS: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, chronic pain, chronic spinal pain, chronic opioid therapy, obesity, smoking, cardiovascular risk factors, pulmonary risk factors.","University of Michigan School of Public Health, Ann Arbor, MI.",2016,NA
4,,27046366,Screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,"IMPORTANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in the United States.OBJECTIVE: To systematically review literature on the accuracy of screening questionnaires and office-based screening pulmonary function testing and the efficacy and harms of treatment of screen-detected COPD.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published through January 2015.STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened abstracts and studies. The search yielded 13,141 unique citations; 465 full-text articles were reviewed, and 33 studies met the inclusion criteria.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers rated the quality of each study using USPSTF criteria.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value [NPV]; treatment efficacy (COPD exacerbations, all-cause mortality, quality of life, and dyspnea); and treatment harms.RESULTS: All screening questionnaires were based on symptoms as well as risk factors such as age and smoking history. The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire was the most extensively studied (5 studies, n = 3048), with moderate overall performance for COPD detection: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.65 to 0.72; sensitivity, 80% to 93%; and specificity, 24% to 49%, at a threshold of greater than 16.5. Positive predictive value and NPV ranged from 17% to 45% and 76% to 98%, respectively. For pulmonary function-based screening tools, FEV1/FEV6 was the best studied (3 studies, n = 1587), with AUC ranging from 0.84 to 0.85. Sensitivity ranged from 51% to 80%. Specificity (range, 90%-95%) and PPV (range, 63%-75%) appeared better than questionnaires. There was not strong evidence to support that screening and supplying smokers with spirometry results improves smoking cessation rates. Treatment trials were unavailable for screen-detected patients. Trials that reported outcomes in patients with mild to moderate COPD included 2 trials of long-acting β-agonists (LABAs) (n = 3174), 1 RCT of LABAs and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (n = 1097), 5 RCTs of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist tiotropium (n = 4592), and 6 RCTs of ICS (n = 3983). They suggested no benefit in all-cause mortality, but a decrease in annual rates of exacerbations with pharmacologic treatments. Few trials reported harms for any individual drug class. Adverse effects were generally mild (eg, dry mouth and cough).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There was no direct evidence available to determine the benefits and harms of screening asymptomatic adults for COPD using questionnaires or office-based screening pulmonary function testing or to determine the benefits of treatment in screen-detected populations. Indirect evidence suggests that the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire has moderate overall performance for COPD detection. Among patients with mild to moderate COPD, the benefit of pharmacotherapy for reducing exacerbations was modest.","Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle2Kaiser Permanente Research Affiliates Evidence-based Practice Center, Portland, Oregon.",2016,10.1001/jama.2016.2654
5,,26857563,Effectiveness of an Electronic Booster Session Delivered to Mandated Students.,"College student drinking continues to be a problem in the United States. Students who have violated campus alcohol policy are at particularly high risk for dangerous drinking. While Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) has been found to be an effective strategy in reducing high-risk drinking and associated consequences, questions remain about ways to further reduce risk or sustain changes associated with a face-to face intervention. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a computer-delivered personalized feedback (electronic booster) delivered to policy violators who completed a mandated BASICS program. At 3-month post-intervention, 346 participants (60.4% male and 39.6% female) were randomized to one of two conditions: assessment only (n = 171) or electronic booster feedback (n = 175). Follow-up assessments were given to all participants at 3, 6, and 12-month post-initial intervention. Both groups showed reductions in drinking after the in-person BASICS intervention, but no additional reductions were seen with the addition of an electronic booster session. Findings suggest that although brief motivational interventions delivered in person to mandated students have been shown to be effective with mandated students, there is no additional benefit from an electronic booster session delivered 3-month post-intervention for this population.","University of Massachusetts Amherst, MA, USA sallyl@umass.edu.",2016,10.1177/0272684X16628726
6,,26767821,Alcohol withdrawal management in adult patients in a high acuity medical surgical transitional care unit: a best practice implementation project.,"BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption, a major health problem worldwide, affects about 6% of the United States population. Caring for patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital ward presents complex physiologic and psycho-social challenges which are best met with evidence-based practices. An academic medical center in the United States has been experiencing an increase in patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, gaps in clinician knowledge and infrastructure supporting the management of these patients still existed.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to improve the continuity of care of patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal in a medical surgical high acuity transitional care unit by incorporating evidence-based practices, and thereby to positively impact on patient outcomes. Specific objectives were related to standardized assessments and pharmacologic management strategies.METHODS: The project used the Joanna Briggs Institute's Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System and Getting Research into Practice audit tool for promoting change in health practice. A baseline clinical audit was conducted to assess compliance with best practices for managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which was followed by several interventions targeted at nurses and providers. A follow-up audit was conducted to assess compliance with the implemented strategies. The follow-up audit used the same evidence-based audit criteria as those used for the baseline audit. A non-probabilistic, convenience sampling approach was used. A sample size of 15 patients was used for both the baseline and follow-up audits.RESULTS: The baseline audit revealed a high compliance rate for four of the five audit criteria concerning risk assessment and pharmacologic strategies. There was sub-optimal compliance (53%) with the criterion regarding use of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (revised) (CIWA-Ar) scale to assess patients with alcohol withdrawal. After the interventions were implemented this criterion recorded an improvement to 100% compliance. None of the patients in the pilot were transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for reasons relating to alcohol withdrawal.CONCLUSIONS: The outcomes of this project demonstrated alcohol withdrawal management can be safely undertaken outside the ICU when the patients are appropriately assessed and treated for the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. This new clinical program significantly impacted on continuity of care. Challenges were resolved using an interdisciplinary team approach. The project resulted in plans for further areas of work concerning alcohol withdrawal management, including adoption of similar approaches by other acute and transitional care units.",University of California San Francisco.,2016,10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2529
7,,26703708,Indicated Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in South Africa: Effectiveness of Case Management.,"In the Western Cape Province of South Africa (ZA) a subculture of binge drinking produces the highest global documented prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD prevention research activities in ZA use the Comprehensive Prevention approach from the United States Institute of Medicine. Case management (CM) was delivered as a method of indicated prevention to empower heavy drinking pregnant women to achieve cessation or a reduction in drinking. CM activities incorporated life management, Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques and the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. Mean drinking decreases 6 months into CM; but overall alcohol consumption rose significantly over time to levels higher than baseline at 12 and 18 months. Alcohol consumption drops significantly from before pregnancy to the second and third trimesters. AUDIT scores indicate that problematic drinking decreases significantly even after the vulnerable fetus/baby was born. CM significantly increases client happiness, which correlates with reduced weekend drinking. CM was successful for women with high-risk drinking behaviour, and was effective in helping women stop drinking, or drink less, while pregnant, reducing the risk of FASD.","Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Stellenbosch University, Tygerberg 7505, South Africa. pmay@email.unc.edu.",2015,10.3390/ijerph13010076
8,,26663383,"Cancer screening, prevention, and treatment in people with mental illness.","People with mental illness die decades earlier in the United States compared with the general population. Most of this disparity is related to preventable and treatable chronic conditions, with many studies finding cancer as the second leading cause of death. Individual lifestyle factors, such as smoking or limited adherence to treatment, are often cited as highly significant issues in shaping risk among persons with mental illness. However, many contextual or systems-level factors exacerbate these individual factors and may fundamentally drive health disparities among people with mental illness. The authors conducted an integrative review to summarize the empirical literature on cancer prevention, screening, and treatment for people with mental illness. Although multiple interventions are being developed and tested to address tobacco dependence and obesity in these populations, the evidence for effectiveness is quite limited, and essentially all prevention interventions focus at the individual level. This review identified only one published article describing evidence-based interventions to promote cancer screening and improve cancer treatment in people with mental illness. On the basis of a literature review and the experience and expertise of the authors, each section in this article concludes with suggestions at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy levels that may improve cancer prevention, screening, and treatment in people with mental illness.","Associate Professor, Department of Family and Community Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.",2015,10.3322/caac.21334
9,,26599083,Prevalence and Correlates of Client-Perpetrated Violence against Female Sex Workers in 13 Mexican Cities.,"BACKGROUND: Globally, client-perpetrated violence against female sex workers (FSWs) has been associated with multiple health-related harms, including high-risk sexual behavior and increased exposure to HIV/STIs. This study examined correlates of client-perpetrated sexual, physical, and economic violence (e.g., robbery) against FSWs in 13 cities throughout Mexico.METHODS: FSWs (N = 1,089) who were enrolled in a brief, evidence-based, sexual risk reduction intervention for FSWs (Mujer Segura) were interviewed about their work context, including experiences of violence perpetrated by clients, sexual risk and substance use practices, financial need, and social supports. Three broad categories of factors (sociodemographic, work context, behavioral and social characteristics of FSWs) were examined as correlates of sexual, physical, and economic violence.RESULTS: The prevalence of different types of client-perpetrated violence against FSWs in the past 6 months was: sexual (11.7%), physical (11.8%), economic (16.9%), and any violence (22.6%). Greater financial need, self-identification as a street worker, and lower perceived emotional support were independently associated with all three types of violence. Alcohol use before or during sex with clients in the past month was associated with physical and sexual violence. Using drugs before or during sex with clients, injection drug use in the past month, and population size of city were associated with sexual violence only, and FSWs' alcohol use score (AUDIT-C) was associated with economic violence only.CONCLUSIONS: Correlates of client-perpetrated violence encompassed sociodemographic, work context, and behavioral and social factors, suggesting that approaches to violence prevention for FSWs must be multi-dimensional. Prevention could involve teaching FSWs strategies for risk avoidance in the workplace (e.g., avoiding use of alcohol with clients), enhancement of FSWs' community-based supports, development of interventions that deliver an anti-violence curriculum to clients, and programs to address FSWs' financial need by increasing their economic opportunities outside of the sex trade.","Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92093-0680, United States of America.",2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0143317

Recruited subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) a mouthwash containing 0.075% CPC in a fluoride-free, alcohol-free base (CPC); (2) a commercially-available mouthwash containing essential oils in a fluoride-free, 21.6% alcohol base (EO); or (3) a fluoride-free, alcohol-free non-antibacterial mouthwash (NC). Subjects were instructed to rinse with the assigned mouthwash, after tooth brushing, twice daily (morning and evening). After 4 and 6 weeks of product use, subjects were examined for gingivitis (Whole Mouth Gingival, Gingival Interproximal, Gingival Severity Indexes) and plaque (Whole Mouth Plaque, Plaque Interproximal, and Plaque Severity Indexes) parameters. For treatment group comparisons, ANCOVA and post hoc Tukey's pair-wise comparisons (α = 0.05) were performed.RESULTS: 132 subjects were screened; 120 were enrolled; and 116 completed the study. After 6 weeks of product use, subjects using the CPC and EO mouthwashes exhibited statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) reductions of all gingival and plaque measurements compared to subjects using the NC mouthwash. Subjects using the CPC mouthwash did not exhibit a statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05) reduction with respect to gingival severity and all plaque measures (Whole, Interproximal, and Severity) when compared to EO mouthwash.

11,,26579780,Statewide Administration of the CRAFFT Screening Tool: Highlighting the Spectrum of Substance Use.,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent alcohol and drug use in the United States are associated with negative consequences spanning multiple domains. Much of the public health surveillance of these behaviors relies on self-report survey data. These data frequently takes the form of frequency or prevalence data for specific substances, which may not provide a complete picture of use.OBJECTIVES: This study analyzes a state-level survey that includes the CRAFFT screening tool. The study's goal is to elucidate the spectrum of substance use severity across a large segment of substance-using adolescents attending schools in the state of Indiana and to assess the contribution of a variety of predictor variables to the variance between users falling into each category of use severity.METHODS: Data were collected in 2011 from 168,801 adolescents, of whom 25,204 met the inclusion criteria for this study. The authors utilize multinomial logit analyses to highlight variables, including sociodemographic data, poly-drug use, and risk/protective behavior scales, associated with each category of use.RESULTS: Seriousness of use is not uniform across substance-using adolescents; 49% were categorized as nonproblem users, 33% as problem users, and 18% as dependent users. Risk and protective factors predict adolescents' severity of substance use, but do not do so uniformly. Poly-drug use is a significant predictor of problem use and dependent use as well.CONCLUSIONS: The CRAFFT may provide a more nuanced perspective of adolescent substance use than frequency/prevalence data alone; the authors describe the implications derived from these data and analyses to the adolescent prevention and treatment systems.","a School of Public Health , Indiana University , Bloomington , Indiana , USA.",2015,10.3109/10826084.2015.1027930
12,,26544982,Kidney-Failure Risk Projection for the Living Kidney-Donor Candidate.,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of candidates to serve as living kidney donors relies on screening for individual risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To support an empirical approach to donor selection, we developed a tool that simultaneously incorporates multiple health characteristics to estimate a person's probable long-term risk of ESRD if that person does not donate a kidney.METHODS: We used risk associations from a meta-analysis of seven general population cohorts, calibrated to the population-level incidence of ESRD and mortality in the United States, to project the estimated long-term incidence of ESRD among persons who do not donate a kidney, according to 10 demographic and health characteristics. We then compared 15-year projections with the observed risk among 52,998 living kidney donors in the United States.RESULTS: A total of 4,933,314 participants from seven cohorts were followed for a median of 4 to 16 years. For a 40-year-old person with health characteristics that were similar to those of age-matched kidney donors, the 15-year projections of the risk of ESRD in the absence of donation varied according to race and sex; the risk was 0.24% among black men, 0.15% among black women, 0.06% among white men, and 0.04% among white women. Risk projections were higher in the presence of a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher albuminuria, hypertension, current or former smoking, diabetes, and obesity. In the model-based lifetime projections, the risk of ESRD was highest among persons in the youngest age group, particularly among young blacks. The 15-year observed risks after donation among kidney donors in the United States were 3.5 to 5.3 times as high as the projected risks in the absence of donation.CONCLUSIONS: Multiple demographic and health characteristics may be used together to estimate the projected long-term risk of ESRD among living kidney-donor candidates and to inform acceptance criteria for kidney donors.

13,,26530717,Pricing of alcohol in Canada: A comparison of provincial policies and harm-reduction opportunities.,"INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Alcohol pricing is an effective prevention policy. This paper compares the 10 Canadian provinces on three research-based alcohol pricing policies-minimum pricing, pricing by alcohol content and maintaining prices relative to inflation.DESIGN AND METHODS: The selection of these three policies was based on systematic reviews and seminal research papers. Provincial data for 2012 were obtained from Statistics Canada and relevant provincial ministries, subsequently sent to provincial authorities for verification, and then scored by team members.RESULTS: All provinces, except for Alberta, have minimum prices for at least one beverage type sold in off-premise outlets. All provinces, except for British Columbia and Quebec, have separate (and higher) minimum pricing for on-premise establishments. Regarding pricing on alcohol content, western and central provinces typically scored higher than provinces in Eastern Canada. Generally, minimum prices were lower than the recommended $1.50 per standard drink for off-premise outlets and $3.00 per standard drink in on-premise venues. Seven of 10 provinces scored 60% or higher compared to the ideal on indexing prices to inflation. Prices for a representative basket of alcohol products in Ontario and Quebec have lagged significantly behind inflation since 2006.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While examples of evidence-based alcohol pricing policies can be found in every jurisdiction in Canada, significant inter-provincial variation leaves substantial unrealised potential for further reducing alcohol-related harm and costs. This comparative assessment of alcohol price policies provides clear indications of how individual provinces could adjust their pricing policies and practices to improve public health and safety.

14,,26500036,Clinical impact of alcohol-related cirrhosis in the next decade: estimates based on current epidemiological trends in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Identifying changes in the epidemiology of liver disease is critical for establishing healthcare priorities and allocating resources to develop therapies. The projected contribution of different etiologies toward development of cirrhosis in the United States was estimated based on current publications on epidemiological data and advances in therapy. Given the heterogeneity of published reports and the different perceptions that are not always reconcilable, a critical overview rather than a formal meta-analysis of the existing data and projections for the next decade was performed.METHODS: Data from the World Health Organization Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health of 2014, Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from 1999 to 2012, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were inquired to determine future changes in the epidemiology of liver disease.RESULTS: Alcohol consumption has increased over the past 60 years. In 2010, transplant-related costs for liver recipients were the highest for hepatitis C (~$124 million) followed by alcohol-related cirrhosis (~$86 million). We anticipate a significant reduction in incidence cirrhosis due to causes other than alcohol because of the availability of high efficiency antiviral agents for hepatitis C, universal and effective vaccination for hepatitis B, relative stabilization of the obesity trends in the United States, and novel, potentially effective therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The proportion of alcohol-related liver disease is therefore likely to increase in both the population as a whole and the liver transplant wait list.CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol-related cirrhosis and alcohol-related liver disorders will be the major cause of liver disease in the coming decades. There is an urgent need to allocate resources aimed toward understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its complications so that effective therapies can be developed.","Departments of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Transplant Surgery, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.",2015,10.1111/acer.12887
15,,26483244,Lung Cancer Risk and Demographic Characteristics of Current 20-29 Pack-year Smokers: Implications for Screening.,"BACKGROUND: Based on current recommendations, 30+ pack-years of smoking are required for eligibility for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening; former smokers must have quit within 15 years. We investigated whether current smokers with 20 to 29 pack-years have similar lung cancer risks as eligible former smokers and also whether they have a different demographic profile.METHODS: The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) was a randomly assigned screening trial of subjects age 55 to 74 years with chest radiographs (CXR) used for lung cancer. Subjects completed a baseline questionnaire containing smoking history questions. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and sex, were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for various smoking history groups. Next, we utilized the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), which inquired about smoking history and race/ethnicity, to analyze the demographic profiles of various high-risk smoking history categories. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: The PLCO cohort included 18 114 former and 12 243 current LDCT-eligible smokers, plus 2283 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers. The hazard ratio for 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers compared with eligible (30+ pack-year) former smokers was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 1.5). Based on the NHIS, 10 million persons in the United States are currently LDCT eligible; an additional 1.6 million (16%, 95% CI = 13.6% to 19.0%) are 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers. The percentage increase in eligibles if 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers were included was substantially greater for women than men (22.2%, 95% CI = 17.9% to 26.7%; vs 12.2%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 15.3%, P &lt; .001) and for minorities than non-Hispanic whites (30.0%, 95% CI = 24.2% to 36.0%; vs 14.1%, 95% CI = 11.1% to 17.0%, P &lt; .001).CONCLUSION: The potential benefits and harms of recommending LDCT screening for 20 to 29-pack-year current smokers should be assessed.","Division of Cancer Prevention, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD pp4f@nih.gov.",2015,10.1093/jnci/djv226
16,,26474231,Adolescent Pregnancy Guidelines.,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the needs and evidence-based practice specific to care of the pregnant adolescent in Canada, including special populations.OUTCOMES: Healthy pregnancies for adolescent women in Canada, with culturally sensitive and age-appropriate care to ensure the best possible outcomes for these young women and their infants and young families, and to reduce repeat pregnancy rates.EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed and The Cochrane Library on May 23, 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., Pregnancy in Adolescence) and key words (e.g., pregnancy, teen, youth). Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Results were limited to English or French language materials published in or after 1990. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to July 6, 2013. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, national and international medical specialty societies, and clinical practice guideline collections.VALUES: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS/HARMS/COSTS: These guidelines are designed to help practitioners caring for adolescent women during pregnancy in Canada and allow them to take the best care of these young women in a manner appropriate for their age, cultural backgrounds, and risk profiles.RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Health care providers should adapt their prenatal care for adolescents and offer multidisciplinary care that is easily accessible to the adolescent early in the pregnancy, recognizing that adolescents often present to care later than their adult counterparts. A model that provides an opportunity to address all of these needs at one site may be the preferred model of care for pregnant adolescents. (II-1A) 2. Health care providers should be sensitive to the unique developmental needs of adolescents through all stages of pregnancy and during intrapartum and postpartum care. (III-B) 3. Adolescents have high-risk pregnancies and should be managed accordingly within programs that have the capacity to manage their care. The unique physical risks of adolescent pregnancy should be recognized and the care provided must address these. (II-1A) 4. Fathers and partners should be included as much as possible in pregnancy care and prenatal/infant care education. (III-B) 5. A first-trimester ultrasound is recommended not only for the usual reasons for properly dating the pregnancy, but also for assessing the increased risks of preterm birth. (I-A) 6. Counselling about all available pregnancy outcome options (abortion, adoption, and parenting) should be provided to any adolescent with a confirmed intrauterine gestation. (III-A) 7. Testing for sexually transmitted infections (STI) (II-2A) and bacterial vaginosis (III-B) should be performed routinely upon presentation for pregnancy care and again in the third trimester; STI testing should also be performed postpartum and when needed symptomatically. a. Because pregnant adolescents are inherently at increased risk for preterm labour, preterm birth, and preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes, screening and management of bacterial vaginosis is recommended. (III-B) b. After treatment for a positive test, a test of cure is needed 3 to 4 weeks after completion of treatment. Refer partner for screening and treatment. Take the opportunity to discuss condom use. (III-A) 8. Routine and repeated screening for alcohol use, substance abuse, and violence in pregnancy is recommended because of their increased rates in this population. (II-2A) 9. Routine and repeated screening for and treatment of mood disorders in pregnancy is recommended because of their increased rates in this population. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale administered in each trimester and postpartum, and more frequently if deemed necessary, is one option for such screening. (II-2A) 10. Pregnant adolescents should have a nutritional assessment, vitamins and food supplementation if needed, and access to a strategy to reduce anemia and low birth weight and to optimize weight gain in pregnancy. (II-2A) 11. Conflicting evidence supports and refutes differences in gestational hypertension in the adolescent population; therefore, the care usual for adult populations is supported for pregnant adolescents at this time. (II-2A) 12. Practitioners should consult gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) guidelines. In theory, testing all patients is appropriate, although rates of GDM are generally lower in adolescent populations. Practitioners should be aware, however, that certain ethnic groups including Aboriginal populations are at high risk of GDM. (II-2A) 13. An ultrasound anatomical assessment at 16 to 20 weeks is recommended because of increased rates of congenital anomalies in this population. (II-2A) 14. As in other populations at risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight, an ultrasound to assess fetal well-being and estimated fetal weight at 32 to 34 weeks gestational age is suggested to screen for IUGR. (III-A) 15. Visits in the second or third trimester should be more frequent to address the increased risk of preterm labour and preterm birth and to assess fetal well-being. All caregivers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of preterm labour and should educate their patients to recognize them. (III-A) 16. It should be recognized that adolescents have improved vaginal delivery rates and a concomitantly lower Caesarean section rate than their adult counterparts. (II-2A) As with antenatal care, peripartum care in hospital should be multidisciplinary, involving social care, support for breastfeeding and lactation, and the involvement of children's aid services when warranted. (III-B) 17. Postpartum care should include a focus on contraceptive methods, especially long-acting reversible contraception methods, as a means to decrease the high rates of repeat pregnancy in this population; discussion of contraception should begin before delivery. (III-A) 18. Breastfeeding should be recommended and sufficient support given to this population at high risk for discontinuation. (II-2A) 19. Postpartum care programs should be available to support adolescent parents and their children, to improve the mothers' knowledge of parenting, to increase breastfeeding rates, to screen for and manage postpartum depression, to increase birth intervals, and to decrease repeated unintended pregnancy rates. (III-B) 20. Adolescent women in rural, remote, northern, and Aboriginal communities should be supported to give birth as close to home as possible. (II-2A) 21. Adolescent pregnant women who need to be evacuated from a remote community should be able to have a family member or other person accompany them to provide support and encouragement. (II-2A) 22. Culturally safe prenatal care including emotional, educational, and clinical support to assist adolescent parents in leading healthier lives should be available, especially in northern and Aboriginal communities. (II-3A) 23. Cultural beliefs around miscarriage and pregnancy issues, and special considerations in the handling of fetal remains, placental tissue, and the umbilical cord, must be respected.

17,,26465664,Vocal warm-up and breathing training for teachers: randomized clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of two speech therapy interventions, vocal warm-up and breathing training, focusing on teachers' voice quality.METHODS A single-blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial was conducted. The research included 31 20 to 60-year old teachers from a public school in Salvador, BA, Northeasatern Brazil, with minimum workloads of 20 hours a week, who have or have not reported having vocal alterations. The exclusion criteria were the following: being a smoker, excessive alcohol consumption, receiving additional speech therapy assistance while taking part in the study, being affected by upper respiratory tract infections, professional use of the voice in another activity, neurological disorders, and history of cardiopulmonary pathologies. The subjects were distributed through simple randomization in groups vocal warm-up (n = 14) and breathing training (n = 17). The teachers' voice quality was subjectively evaluated through the Voice Handicap Index (Índice de Desvantagem Vocal, in the Brazilian version) and computerized voice analysis (average fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise, and glottal-to-noise excitation ratio) by speech therapists.RESULTS Before the interventions, the groups were similar regarding sociodemographic characteristics, teaching activities, and vocal quality. The variations before and after the intervention in self-assessment and acoustic voice indicators have not significantly differed between the groups. In the comparison between groups before and after the six-week interventions, significant reductions in the Voice Handicap Index of subjects in both groups were observed, as wells as reduced average fundamental frequencies in the vocal warm-up group and increased shimmer in the breathing training group. Subjects from the vocal warm-up group reported speaking more easily and having their voices more improved in a general way as compared to the breathing training group.CONCLUSIONS Both interventions were similar regarding their effects on the teachers' voice quality. However, each contribution has individually contributed to improve the teachers' voice quality, especially the vocal warm-up.TRIAL RECORD NCT02102399, &quot;Vocal Warm-up and Respiratory Muscle Training in Teachers&quot;.","Departamento de Fonoaudiologia, Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, BR.",2015,10.1590/S0034-8910.2015049005716

Behavioral interventions increased smoking cessation at 6 months or more (physician advice had a pooled risk ratio [RR] of 1.76 [95% CI, 1.58 to 1.96]). Nicotine replacement therapy (RR, 1.60 [CI, 1.53 to 1.68]), bupropion (RR, 1.62 [CI, 1.49 to 1.76]), and varenicline (RR, 2.27 [CI, 2.02 to 2.55]) were also effective for smoking cessation. Combined behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions increased cessation by 82% compared with minimal intervention or usual care (RR, 1.82 [CI, 1.66 to 2.00]). None of the drugs were associated with major cardiovascular adverse events. Only 2 trials addressed efficacy of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation and found no benefit. Among pregnant women, behavioral interventions benefited cessation and perinatal health; effects of nicotine replacement therapy were not significant.LIMITATION: Evidence published after each review's last search date was not included.CONCLUSION: Behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions improve rates of smoking cessation among the general adult population, alone or in combination. Data on the effectiveness and safety of electronic nicotine delivery systems are limited.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",NA,2015,10.7326/M15-0171
19,,26374203,The Tobacco Status Project (TSP): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention for young adults.,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality in the United States. Young adults are less successful at quitting, use cessation treatment less often than smokers of other ages, and can be a challenge to retain in treatment. Social media, integrated into the lives of many young adults, represents a promising strategy to deliver evidence-based smoking cessation treatment to a large, diverse audience. The goal of this trial is to test the efficacy of a stage-based smoking cessation intervention on Facebook for young adults age 18 to 25 on smoking abstinence, reduction in cigarettes smoked, and thoughts about smoking abstinence.DESIGN: This is a randomized controlled trial. Young adult smokers throughout the United States are recruited online and randomized to either the 3 month Tobacco Status Project intervention on Facebook or a referral to a smoking cessation website. The intervention consists of assignment to a secret Facebook group tailored to readiness to quit smoking (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation), daily Facebook contacts tailored to readiness to quit smoking, weekly live counseling sessions, and for those in preparation, weekly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy counseling sessions on Facebook. Primary outcome measure is biochemically-verified 7-day point prevalence abstinence from smoking at posttreatment (3 months), 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures are reduction of 50 % or more in cigarettes smoked, 24 h quit attempts, and commitment to abstinence at each time point. A secondary aim is to test, within the TSP condition, the effect of a monetary incentive at increasing engagement in the intervention.DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled trial is testing a novel Facebook intervention for treating young adults' tobacco use. If efficacious, the social media intervention could be disseminated widely and expanded to address additional health risks.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02207036 , May 13, 2014.","Department of Psychiatry, University of California, 401 Parnassus Avenue, Box TRC 0984, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.

20,,26346395,"Polysomnographic sleep disturbances in nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, cocaine, opioid, and cannabis use: A focused review.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the United States, approximately 60 million Americans suffer from sleep disorders and about 22 million Americans report substance dependence or use disorders annually. Sleep disturbances are common consequences of substance use disorders and are likely found in primary care as well as in specialty practices. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effects of the most frequently used substances-nicotine, alcohol, opioids, cocaine, caffeine, and cannabis-have on sleep parameters measured by polysomnography (PSG) and related clinical manifestations.METHODS: We used electronic databases such as PubMED and PsycINFO to search for relevant articles. We only included studies that assessed sleep disturbances using polysomnography and reviewed the effects of these substances on six clinically relevant sleep parameters: Total sleep time, sleep onset latency, rapid-eye movement, REM latency, wake after sleep onset, and slow wave sleep.RESULTS: Our review indicates that these substances have significant impact on sleep and that their effects differ during intoxication, withdrawal, and chronic use. Many of the substance-induced sleep disturbances overlap with those encountered in sleep disorders, medical, and psychiatric conditions. Sleep difficulties also increase the likelihood of substance use disorder relapse, further emphasizing the need for optimizing treatment interventions in these patients.CONCLUSION AND SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our review highlights the importance of systematically screening for substance use in patients with sleep disturbances and highlights the need for further research to understand mechanisms underlying substances-induced sleep disturbances and on effective interventions addressing these conditions.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida.",2015,10.1111/ajad.12291
21,,26223781,Cultural adaptation of a brief motivational intervention for heavy drinking among Hispanics in a medical setting.,"BACKGROUND: Hispanics, particularly men of Mexican origin, are more likely to engage in heavy drinking and experience alcohol-related problems, but less likely to obtain treatment for alcohol problems than non-Hispanic men. Our previous research indicates that heavy-drinking Hispanics who received a brief motivational intervention (BMI) were significantly more likely than Hispanics receiving standard care to reduce subsequent alcohol use. Among Hispanics who drink heavily the BMI effectively reduced alcohol use but did not impact alcohol-related problems or treatment utilization. We hypothesized that an adapted BMI that integrates cultural values and addresses acculturative stress among Hispanics would be more effective.DESIGN: We describe here the protocol for the design and implementation of a randomized (approximately 300 patients per condition) controlled trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness of a culturally adapted (CA) BMI in contrast to a non-adapted BMI (NA-BMI) in a community hospital setting among men of Mexican origin. Study participants will include men who were hospitalized due to an alcohol related injury or screened positive for heavy drinking. By accounting for risk and protective factors of heavy drinking among Hispanics, we hypothesize that CA-BMI will significantly decrease alcohol use and alcohol problems, and increase help-seeking and treatment utilization.DISCUSSION: This is likely the first study to directly address alcohol related health disparities among non-treatment seeking men of Mexican origin by comparing the benefits of a CA-BMI to a NA-BMI. This study stands to not only inform interventions used in medical settings to reduce alcohol-related health disparities, but may also help reduce the public health burden of heavy alcohol use in the United States.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial registration clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT02429401; Registration date: April 28, 2015.","Department of Psychology, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 W.

22,,26215529,Prevalence of cirrhosis in hepatitis C patients in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS): a retrospective and prospective observational study.,"OBJECTIVES: The severity of liver disease in the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected population in the United States remains uncertain. We estimated the prevalence of cirrhosis in adults with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) using multiple parameters including liver biopsy, diagnosis/procedure codes, and a biomarker.METHODS: Patients enrolled in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS) who received health services during 2006-2010 were included. Cirrhosis was identified through liver biopsy reports, diagnosis/procedure codes for cirrhosis or hepatic decompensation, and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores ≥5.88. Demographic and clinical characteristics associated with cirrhosis were identified through multivariable logistic modeling.RESULTS: Among 9,783 patients, 2,788 (28.5%) were cirrhotic by at least one method. Biopsy identified cirrhosis in only 661 (7%) patients, whereas FIB-4 scores and diagnosis/procedure codes for cirrhosis and hepatic decompensation identified cirrhosis in 2,194 (22%), 557 (6%), and 482 (5%) patients, respectively. Among 661 patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis, only 356 (54%) had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for cirrhosis. Older age, male gender, Asian race, Hispanic ethnicity, genotype 3 infection, HIV coinfection, diabetes, history of antiviral therapy, and history of alcohol abuse were independently associated with higher odds of cirrhosis (all, P&lt;0.05). Conversely, private health insurance coverage, black race, and HCV genotype 2 were associated with lower odds of cirrhosis.CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis are not assigned ICD-9 codes for cirrhosis. Consequently, ICD-9 codes may not be reliable as the sole indicator of the prevalence of cirrhosis in cohort studies. Use of additional parameters suggests a fourfold higher prevalence of cirrhosis than is revealed by biopsy alone. These findings suggest that cirrhosis in CHC patients may be significantly underdocumented and underdiagnosed.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, USA.",2015,10.1038/ajg.2015.203
23,,26180222,Outcomes of a Tailored Intervention for Cigarette Smoking Cessation Among Latinos Living With HIV/AIDS.,"INTRODUCTION: Tobacco use has emerged as a leading killer among persons living with HIV, with effective approaches to tobacco treatment still unknown. HIV infection is nearly 3 times as prevalent in Latinos than in non-Latino Whites. This study reports the results of a randomized trial comparing a tailored intervention to brief counseling for smoking cessation among Latino smokers living with HIV (LSLWH).METHODS: LSLWH (N = 302; 36% female, 10% employed full-time, 49% born in United States) were randomized to 4 in-person sessions of a tailored intervention (Aurora) or 2 in-person sessions of brief advice (enhanced standard care [ESC]). Both groups received 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patch. Biochemically validated 6- and 12-month 7-day point-prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates were compared, along with secondary outcomes (e.g., reduction to light smoking, NRT adherence).RESULTS: Seven-day PPA rates reached 8% versus 11% at 6 months and 6% versus 7% at 12 months, for Aurora and ESC, respectively, with no between-group differences (p values &gt; .40). Significant changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months among intervention targets were noted (percentage reduction in heavy smoking and dependence; increases in knowledge and self-efficacy). Baseline smoking frequency, older age, and higher intensity of patch use during the trial emerged as significant predictors of abstinence at 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the tailored intervention improved cessation rates. Interventions that encourage use of, and adherence to, empirically validated cessation aids require further development to reduce tobacco-related death and disease in this vulnerable population.","Department of Oncology, Georgetown University Medical Center/Cancer Prevention and Control Program, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center; Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies, American Legacy Foundation; Westat, Behavioral Health Group; Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University; CassandraStanton@westat.com.",2015,10.1093/ntr/ntv014

This study evaluates the effectiveness of HF with Intensive Case Management (ICM) among ethnically diverse homeless adults in an urban setting. 378 participants were randomized to HF with ICM or treatment-as-usual (TAU) in Toronto (Canada), and followed for 24 months. Measures of effectiveness included housing stability, physical (EQ5D-VAS) and mental (CSI, GAIN-SS) health, social functioning (MCAS), quality of life (QoLI20), and health service use. Two-thirds of the sample (63%) was from racialized groups and half (50%) were born outside Canada. Over the 24 months of follow-up, HF participants spent a significantly greater percentage of time in stable residences compared to TAU participants (75.1% 95% CI 70.5 to 79.7 vs. 39.3% 95% CI 34.3 to 44.2, respectively). Similarly, community functioning (MCAS) improved significantly from baseline in HF compared to TAU participants (change in mean difference = +1.67 95% CI 0.04 to 3.30). There was a significant reduction in the number of days spent experiencing alcohol problems among the HF compared to TAU participants at 24 months (ratio of rate ratios = 0.47 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) relative to baseline, a reduction of 53%. Although the number of emergency department visits and days in hospital over 24 months did not differ significantly between HF and TAU participants, fewer HF participants compared to TAU participants had 1 or more hospitalizations during this period (70.4% vs. 81.1%, respectively; P=0.044). Compared to non-racialized HF participants, racialized HF participants saw an increase in the amount of money spent on alcohol (change in mean difference = $112.90 95% CI 5.84 to 219.96) and a reduction in physical community integration (ratio of rate ratios = 0.67 95% CI 0.47 to 0.96) from baseline to 24 months.

Validated postpartum screening scales can help to identify problems early, but currently there is limited knowledge in this area. Thus, we conducted a systematic examination of self-administered psychosocial and behavioral scales validated for postpartum women in the United States in the domains of depression, body image, diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol use. We examined the characteristics of included scales, their validation samples, and reported psychometric properties.METHOD: Nine databases were searched during October 2014 through February 2015. After meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria, article information was extracted independently by two authors, compared, and differences were resolved through discussions.RESULTS: The final sample included 23 published articles covering 19 scales. Seventeen were in the domain of depression, and one each in physical activity and dietary domains. None was found in the domains of body image, smoking, or alcohol use. The number of scale items varied from 2 to 35. The majority of scales were originally designed for postpartum women, and validated in one or two postpartum studies with samples of predominantly adult women. If reported, scale reliability coefficients were generally 0.80 or greater and validity coefficients of 0.70 or greater. Five depression scales had favorable sensitivity and specificity using standard cutpoints, but only one was tested across adolescent, low-income, and predominantly ethnic minority postpartum populations.CONCLUSION: No U.S.-validated postpartum scales were found for body image, smoking, or alcohol use. Most scales had limited validity testing, and validation was in predominantly advantaged samples. Further scale development and testing are recommended.","School of Nursing, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas.

26,,26162361,HIV counseling and testing in tuberculosis contact investigations in the United States and Canada.,"BACKGROUND: Determining the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of tuberculosis (TB) patients and contacts is important. Despite existing guidelines, not all patients are tested, and testing of contacts is rarely performed.METHODS: In a study conducted at nine US/Canadian sites, we introduced formal procedures for offering HIV testing to TB patients and contacts. Data were collected via interviews and medical record review. Characteristics associated with offering and accepting HIV testing were examined.RESULTS: Of 651 TB patients, 601 (92%) were offered testing, 511 (85%) accepted, and 51 (10%) were HIV-infected. Of 4152 contacts, 3099 (75%) were offered testing, 1202 (39%) accepted, and 24 (2%) were HIV-infected. Contacts aged 15-64 years, non-Whites, foreign-born persons, smokers, those with positive TB screening, and household contacts were more likely to be offered testing, whereas contacts exposed to HIV-negative patients were less likely to be offered testing. Contacts aged 15-64 years, smokers, drug/alcohol users, diabetics, and those with positive TB screening were more likely to accept testing. Foreign-born persons, Blacks, Hispanics, and contacts exposed to HIV-positive patients were less likely to accept testing.CONCLUSIONS: High rates of HIV were detected among patients and contacts. Despite structured procedures to offer HIV testing, some patients and most contacts did not accept testing. Strategies are needed to improve testing acceptance rates.","ICAP, Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York, USA.",2015,10.5588/ijtld.14.0642
27,,26160294,Attitudes and Beliefs of Primary Care Providers in New Mexico About Lung Cancer Screening Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography.,"INTRODUCTION: On the basis of results from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), national guidelines now recommend using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) to screen high-risk smokers for lung cancer. Our study objective was to characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of primary care providers about implementing LDCT screening.METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with primary care providers practicing in New Mexico clinics for underserved minority populations. The interviews, conducted from February through September 2014, focused on providers' tobacco cessation efforts, lung cancer screening practices, perceptions of NLST and screening guidelines, and attitudes about informed decision making for cancer screening. Investigators iteratively reviewed transcripts to create a coding structure.RESULTS: We reached thematic saturation after interviewing 10 providers practicing in 6 urban and 4 rural settings; 8 practiced at federally qualified health centers. All 10 providers promoted smoking cessation, some screened with chest x-rays, and none screened with LDCT. Not all were aware of NLST results or current guideline recommendations. Providers viewed study results skeptically, particularly the 95% false-positive rate, the need to screen 320 patients to prevent 1 lung cancer death, and the small proportion of minority participants. Providers were uncertain whether New Mexico had the necessary infrastructure to support high-quality screening, and worried about access barriers and financial burdens for rural, underinsured populations. Providers noted the complexity of discussing benefits and harms of screening and surveillance with their patient population.CONCLUSION: Providers have several concerns about the feasibility and appropriateness of implementing LDCT screening. Effective lung cancer screening programs will need to educate providers and patients to support informed decision making and to ensure that high-quality screening can be efficiently delivered in community practice.","University of New Mexico School of Medicine, University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico.",2015,10.5888/pcd12.150112
28,,26131839,Characteristics of Internal Medicine Physicians Disciplined by Professional Colleges in Canada.,"Physician misconduct is of serious concern to patient safety and quality of care. Currently, there are limited data on disciplinary proceedings involving internal medicine (IM) physicians.The aim of this study was to investigate the number and nature of disciplinary cases among IM physicians compared with those of other disciplined physicians.Our retrospective study reviewed information from all provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) and compiled a database of all disciplined physicians from 2000 to 2013 in Canada. Disciplinary rate differences (RDs) were calculated for IM physicians and compared with other physicians.From 2000 to 2013, overall disciplinary rates were low (9.6 cases per 10,000 physician years). There were 899 disciplinary cases, 49 of which involved 45 different IM physicians. IM physicians comprised 10.8% of all disciplined physicians and were disciplined at a lower rate than non-IM physicians, incurring 5.18 fewer cases per 10,000 physician years than other physicians (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.62-6.73; P &lt; 0.001). They were significantly less likely to be disciplined for: unprofessional conduct (RD 1.16; CI 0.45-1.87; P = 0.001); unlicensed activity (RD 0.78; CI 0.37-1.19; P &lt; 0.001); standard of care issues (RD 1.37; CI 0.49-2.26; P = 0.002); sexual misconduct (RD 1.65; CI 0.90-2.40; P &lt; 0.001); miscellaneous (RD 0.80; CI 0.11-1.50; P = 0.020); mental illness (RD 0.06; CI 0.01-0.12; P = 0.025); inappropriate prescribing (RD 0.74; CI 0.15-1.33; P = 0.010); and criminal conviction (RD 0.33; CI 0.00-0.65; P = 0.048). No significant differences were found with respect to unclear violations, fraudulent behavior/prevarication, or offenses involving drugs/alcohol (all RDs less than 0.32). IM physicians were also less likely to incur the following penalties: voluntary license surrender (RD 0.53; CI 0.37-0.69; P &lt; 0.001); suspension (RD 2.39; CI 1.26-3.51; P &lt; 0.001); retraining/assessment (RD 1.58; CI 0.77-2.39; P &lt; 0.001); restriction (RD 1.60; CI 0.74-2.46; P &lt; 0.001); other (RD 0.52; CI 0.07-0.97; P = 0.030); formal reprimand (RD 2.78; CI 1.77-3.79; P &lt; 0.001); or fine (RD 3.28; CI 1.89-4.67; P &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were found with respect to revocation or mandated counseling/rehabilitation (all RDs less than 0.46).Generally, disciplinary rates among physicians were low. Compared with other physicians, IM physicians have significantly lower disciplinary rates overall and are less likely to incur the majority of disciplinary offenses and penalties.","From the Department of Medicine, University Health Network (JJL); Department of Anesthesia, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (AQA); Institute of Human Nutrition, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York (HRG); Department of Biostatistics, Dalla Lana School of Public Health (JJM); Department of Medicine (CMB); Institute for Health Policy Management and Evaluation, University of Toronto (CMB); and Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (CMB).",2015,10.1097/MD.0000000000000937

Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir were evaluated in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The authors searched state Medicaid Web sites between 23 June and 7 December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate. Any differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on whether sofosbuvir was covered and the criteria for coverage based on the following categories: liver disease stage, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use. Of the 42 states with known Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir, 74% limit sofosbuvir access to persons with advanced fibrosis (Meta-Analysis of Histologic Data in Viral Hepatitis [METAVIR] fibrosis stage F3) or cirrhosis (F4). One quarter of states require persons co-infected with HCV and HIV to be receiving antiretroviral therapy or to have suppressed HIV RNA levels. Two thirds of states have restrictions based on prescriber type, and 88% include drug or alcohol use in their sofosbuvir eligibility criteria, with 50% requiring a period of abstinence and 64% requiring urine drug screening. Heterogeneity is present in Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir with respect to liver disease staging, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use across the United States. Restrictions do not seem to conform with recommendations from professional organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Current restrictions seem to violate federal Medicaid law, which requires states to cover drugs consistent with their U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels.",NA,2015,10.7326/M15-0406
30,,26120760,[Efficacy and safety of medication use for the cessation of tobacco addiction: A review of Clinical Practice Guidelines].,"OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation in the context of clinical practice guidelines (CPG).METHODS: A systematic review of CPGs was conducted, aimed at adapting recommendations for Colombia following the ADAPTE methodology. Outcomes comprised 6-months or higher smoking cessation rates and intervention safety. CPGs were peer-assessed based on DELBI. Results from aggregative studies included in selected CPGs were obtained.RESULTS: Pharmacotherapy doubles smoking cessation rates as compared with placebos (rates @25% and up to 27 % when combined with counseling). The highest efficacy was observed for ansyolitic and antidepressive drugs (8.7 % to 19.4 %), and the lowest for nicotine replacement therapy -NRT- (5.2 % to 12.9 %). Nortriptiline shows an efficacy similar to that of bupropion (@10%). With limited exceptions, combined pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation has shown no significant increase in cessation rates.CONCLUSIONS: NRT, varenicline, bupropion and nortriptiline are effective treatments for smoking cessation. Combination of drugs deserves further clinical evidence and should be restricted to highly dependent smokers or initial therapeutic failure. Cost-effectiveness analyses might help to introduce smoking cessation programs in low and middle income countries.","Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Hospital Universitario San Ignacio, Bogotá, Colombia, alejandra.canas@javeriana.edu.co.",2015,S0124-00642014000500012

The current study was a secondary analysis of 2 clinical trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD) to examine the associations between pain, negative affect and AUD treatment outcomes.METHOD: Participants included 1,383 individuals from the COMBINE Study (COMBINE Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions for Alcohol Dependence; COMBINE Study Research Group, 2003; 31% female, 23% ethnic minorities, average age = 44.4 [SD = 10.2]), a multisite combination pharmacotherapy and behavioral intervention study for AUD in the United States, and 742 individuals from the United Kingdom Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT Research Team, 2001; 25.9% female, 4.4% ethnic minorities, average age = 41.6 [SD = 10.1]) a multisite behavioral intervention study for AUD in the United Kingdom. The Form-90 was used to collect alcohol use data, the Short Form Health Survey and Quality of Life measures were used to assess pain, and negative affect was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory (COMBINE) and the General Health Questionnaire (UKATT).RESULTS: Pain scores were significantly associated with drinking outcomes in both datasets. Greater pain scores were associated with greater negative affect and increases in pain were associated with increases in negative affect. Negative affect significantly mediated the association between pain and drinking outcomes and this effect was moderated by social behavior network therapy (SBNT) in the UKATT study, with SBNT attenuating the association between pain and drinking.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest pain and negative affect are associated among individuals in AUD treatment and that negative affect mediated pain may be a risk factor for alcohol relapse.","Department of Psychology, University of New Mexico.",2015,10.1037/ccp0000033

Many countries, including East Asian countries, have been conducting nationwide quitline services; however, this has not been conducted in Japan. The aim of this study was to characterize quitline services abroad and review their efficacy in helping smokers quit, in order to determine an appropriate scheme for Japan.METHODS: We investigated the present condition of quitline in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, focusing on its modalities. Subsequently, we searched &quot;Medline&quot;and &quot;Cochrane Database of Systematic Review&quot;using free text terms of &quot;hotlines&quot;and &quot;smoking cessation&quot;to review the efficacy of the modalities used by the quitline services. Relevant articles from the reference lists were also identified.RESULTS: In Asia Pacific countries, various tools were used by the quitline services, including a quit booklet, website, mobile phone service, and e-mail. Some of these countries conducted proactive counseling by a quitline counselor. There have been several meta-analyses and randomized-control trials showing the efficacy of individually tailored materials in quitline services. To introduce an effective quitline service in Japan, it is desirable to provide individually tailored materials. In addition, as Japanese smokers can easily access smoking cessation advice in hospitals, health check-up settings, and pharmacies, quitline services should be connected with this infrastructure.CONCLUSION: To introduce an effective nationwide quitline service in Japan, it is necessary to provide various individually tailored materials that complement the smoking cessation infrastructure.",Department of Nursing Sugiyama Jogakuen University.,2015,10.11236/jph.62.3_125
33,,26028643,Development of a simple binary response questionnaire to identify airflow obstruction in a smoking population in Argentina.,"The CODE questionnaire (COPD detection questionnaire), a simple, binary response scale (yes/no), screening questionnaire, was developed for the identification of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We conducted a survey of 468 subjects with a smoking history in 10 public hospitals in Argentina. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COPD, asthma and other respiratory illness were excluded. Items that measured conceptual domains in terms of characteristics of symptoms, smoking history and demographics data were considered. 96 (20.5%) subjects had a diagnosis of COPD according to the 2010 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy document. The variables selected for the final questionnaire were based on univariate and multivariate analyses and clinical criteria. Finally, we selected the presence or absence of six variables (age ≥50 years, smoking history ≥30 pack-years, male sex, chronic cough, chronic phlegm and dyspnoea). Of patients without any of these six variables (0 points), none had COPD. The ability of the CODE questionnaire to discriminate between subjects with and without COPD was good (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.75). Higher scores were associated with a greater probability of COPD. The CODE questionnaire is a brief, accurate questionnaire that can identify smoking individuals likely to have COPD.","Immunology and Obstructive Diseases Division, Argentine Respiratory Medicine Association, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",2015,10.1183/16000617.00005214

Programme outcome measures increasingly include changes in substance use as well as health and wellbeing indicators and measures of risk.SUMMARY: Future programme directions include: expansion of the psychosocial repertoire to include narrative and mindfulness-based therapies; web-based programme delivery; sex-sensitive programming to attract and retain women; comprehensive programming to address coexisting mental and physical illness and polysubstance use (including tobacco smoking); and improving accessibility to promote early intervention. Comparability of evaluation data can be improved by developing standardized tools particularly for measuring change in sexual-risk behavior. The use of new statistical techniques can address the lack of comparison populations.","aSt Vincent's Hospital Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW bSt Vincent's Hospital, Sydney cNational Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, Australia.",2015,10.1097/YCO.0000000000000173

Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, and osteoporosis risk factors (body mass index &lt; 20, glucocorticoid use, secondary osteoporosis, prior high-risk facture, rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol abuse, and current smoking).KEY RESULTS: Among previously unscreened women for whom the USPSTF recommends screening, 7-year cumulative incidence of DXA screening was 58.8 % among women aged 60-64 years with ≥ 1 risk factor (95 % CI: 51.9-65.8 %), 57.8 % for women aged 65-74 years (95 % CI: 55.6-60.0 %), and 42.7 % for women aged ≥ 75 years (95 % CI: 38.7-46.7 %). Among women for whom the USPSTF does not recommend screening, 7-year cumulative incidence was 45.5 % among women aged 50-59 years (95 % CI 44.1-46.9 %) and 58.6 % among women aged 60-64 years without risk factors (95 % CI 55.9-61.4 %).CONCLUSIONS: DXA screening was underused in women at increased fracture risk, including women aged ≥ 65 years. Meanwhile, DXA screening was common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without osteoporosis risk factors. Interventions may be needed to augment the value of population screening for osteoporosis.","Department of Family and Community Medicine, University of California, Davis Health System, Sacramento, CA, USA.",2015,10.1007/s11606-015-3349-8

These performance measures have been controversial due to the limited and equivocal evidence for the efficacy of BI among hospitalized individuals. The few BI trials conducted with hospital inpatients vary widely in methodological quality. While the majority of these studies indicate limited to no effects of BI in this population, none have been designed to account for the most pervasive methodological issue in BI studies presumed to drive study findings towards the null: assessment reactivity (AR).DESIGN: This is a three-arm, single-site, randomized controlled trial of BI for hospitalized patients at a large academic medical center affiliated with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs who use alcohol at hazardous levels but do not have an alcohol use disorder. Participants are randomized to one of three study conditions. Study Arm 1 receives a three-part alcohol BI. Study Arm 2 receives attention control. To account for potential AR, Study Arm 3 receives AC with limited assessment. Primary outcomes will include the number of standard drinks/week and binge drinking episodes reported in the 30-day period prior to a final measurement visit obtained 6 months after hospital discharge. Additional outcomes will include readiness to change drinking behavior and number of adverse consequences of alcohol use. To assess differences in primary outcomes across the three arms, we will use mixed-effects regression models that account for a patient's repeated measures over the timepoints and clustering within medical units. Intervention implementation will be assessed by: a) review of intervention audio recordings to characterize barriers to intervention fidelity; and b) feasibility of participant recruitment, enrollment, and follow-up.DISCUSSION: The results of this methodologically rigorous trial will provide greater justification for or against the use of BI performance measures in the inpatient setting and inform organizational responses to BI-related hospital accreditation and performance measures.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01602172.","Center for Health Equity Research and Promotion, Veterans Affairs (VA) Pittsburgh Healthcare System, University Drive C (151C), Pittsburgh, PA, 15240, USA. lauren.broyles@va.gov.",2015,10.1186/s13722-015-0033-6

We randomized 135 patients who met the criteria for severe AH into the following groups: 35 patients received prednisone (PDN) 40 mg/d, 35 patients received PDN+MTD 500 mg three times daily, 33 patients received pentoxifylline (PTX) 400 mg three times daily, and 32 patients received PTX+MTD 500 mg three times daily. The duration of the treatment for all of the groups was 30 d.RESULTS: In the groups treated with the MTD, the survival rate was higher at 3 mo (PTX+MTD 59.4% vs PTX 33.3%, P = 0.04; PDN+MTD 68.6% vs PDN 20%, P = 0.0001) and at 6 mo (PTX+MTD 50% vs PTX 18.2%, P = 0.01; PDN+MTD 48.6% vs PDN 20%, P = 0.003) than in the groups not treated with MTD. A relapse in alcohol intake was the primary independent factor predicting mortality at 6 mo. The patients receiving MTD maintained greater abstinence than those who did not receive it (74.5% vs 59.4%, P = 0.02).CONCLUSION: MTD improves the 3- and 6-mo survival rates in patients with severe AH. Alcohol abstinence is a key factor for survival in these patients. The patients who received the combination therapy with MTD were more likely to maintain abstinence than those who received monotherapy with either PDN or PTX.","Fátima Higuera-de la Tijera, Eduardo Pérez-Torres, Juan M Abdo-Francis, Francisco Salas-Gordillo, José L Pérez-Hernández, Liver Clinic, Gastroenterology Department, Hospital General de México, Dr. Eduardo Liceaga, Mexico City 06720, Mexico.",2015,10.3748/wjg.v21.i16.4975

Several evidence-based programs have been developed to prevent adolescent substance use. Many of the most rigorously tested and empirically supported prevention programs were initially developed and tested in the United States. Increasingly, these interventions are being adopted for use in Europe and throughout the world. This paper reports on a large-scale comprehensive initiative designed to select, adapt, implement, and sustain an evidence-based drug abuse prevention program in Italy. As part of a large-scale regionally funded collaboration in the Lombardy region of Italy, we report on processes through which a team of stakeholders selected, translated and culturally adapted, planned, implemented and evaluated the Life Skills Training (LST) school-based drug abuse prevention program, an evidence-based intervention developed in the United States. We discuss several challenges and lessons learned and implications for prevention practitioners and researchers attempting to undertake similar international dissemination projects. We review several published conceptual models designed to promote the replication and widespread dissemination of effective programs, and discuss their strengths and limitations in the context of planning and implementing a complex, large-scale real-world dissemination effort.","Regional Observatory on Drug Addiction (OReD)-Éupolis Lombardia, via Taramelli 12, Milan 20124, Italy.

Information about the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse and its association with sociodemographic and psychological variables is needed for designing effective intervention prevention strategies.METHODS: Cross-sectional data were drawn from a baseline assessment that was part of a randomized controlled trial of 278 Latino migrant workers (LMWs) conducted between 2008 and 2010.RESULTS: About one-third (32%) of participants engaged in heavy drinking in the past 30 days prior to baseline interview. More females than males reported no alcohol use in the past 30 days (53.5% vs. 20.5%). On the other hand, more males reported drinking every day or nearly (25.2% vs. 7.1%). Five factors-gender, country of origin, relationship status, living arrangements, and acculturation-were significantly associated with frequency of alcohol consumption. Multivariate analyses indicated that gender, country of origin, education attainment, relationship status, living arrangement, living with children, length of stay in the US, religious beliefs, acculturation, and depression were associated with frequent heavy drinking, alcohol abuse/dependence, and unprotected sex under the influence of alcohol.CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variation in alcohol use among Latino migrant workers. Although a substantial proportion of this population abstains from alcohol, an equally substantial proportion report levels of alcohol use that pose significant risk. More research is needed to better understand drinking patterns in this community in order to design prevention strategies specifically tailored for this population.","Department of Sociobehavioral and Administrative Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Nova Southeastern University, 3200 South University Drive, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33328-2018, United States.

We conducted focus groups with men, women and couples, and obtained feedback from a long-standing Community Collaborative Board (CCB) to guide the synthesis of elements of these three interventions into a new intervention. We then piloted the adapted intervention for feasibility and acceptability.RESULTS: The new intervention is called the Couples' Health CoOp. This intervention targets men who use alcohol and other drugs and engage in unprotected sex, and their main female sex partners. The intervention addresses substance use, sex risk, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, gender roles, gender-based violence, communication skills, and goal-setting activities to increase sexy (eroticize) safe-sex behaviors. The Couples' Health CoOp also includes &quot;voices&quot; from the focus group members to ground the intervention in the experiences of these at-risk couples. In addition, it utilizes a participant handbook that reiterates workshop content and includes homework assignments for couples to complete together to increase problem-solving skills within their relationship, and to improve their sexual relationship and help sustain HIV risk-reduction strategies. All of these adaptations were based on participants' suggestions made during formative work and pilot testing.CONCLUSIONS: The Couples' Health CoOp is a couple-based HIV prevention intervention that targets alcohol and other drug use to reduce sexual risk, reduce gender-based violence and offer alternatives for conflict resolution, promote healthy relationships, and modify traditional gender roles in South Africa.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01121692 .","Substance Abuse Treatment Evaluations and Interventions Research Program, RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA. wmw@rti.org.",2015,10.1186/s13011-015-0005-6

Such a tool would be valuable for identifying those who would most benefit from screening colonoscopy.METHODS: We used baseline data from men and women who underwent screening colonoscopy from the randomized, multicenter National Colonoscopy Study (NCS) to develop and validate an adenoma risk model. The study, conducted at three sites in the United States (Minneapolis, MN; Seattle, WA; and Shreveport, LA) asked all participants to complete baseline questionnaires on clinical risk factors and family history. Model parameters estimated from logistic regression yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) used to assess prediction.RESULTS: Five hundred forty-one subjects were included in the development model, and 1,334 in the validation of the risk score. Variables in the prediction of adenoma risk for colonoscopy screening were age (likelihood ratio test for overall contribution to model, P &lt; 0.001), male sex (P &lt; 0.001), body mass index (P &lt; 0.001), family history of at least one first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (P = 0.036), and smoking history (P &lt; 0.001). The adjusted AUROCC of 0.67 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.74] for the derivation cohort was not statistically significantly different from that in the validation cohort. The adjusted AUROCC for the entire cohort was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.67).CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a simple well-calibrated risk score.IMPACT: This tool may be useful for estimating risk of adenomas in screening eligible men and women.","Section of Gastroenterology, VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

42,,25731073,Improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVES: The use of opioid analgesics in the United States has significantly increased in recent years. However, there is minimal consensus on what discharge counseling should accompany these high-risk prescriptions and large variations in what is done in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dual-modality (written and spoken) literacy-appropriate educational strategy on patients' knowledge of and safe use of opioid analgesics.METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive discharged patients at an urban academic ED (&gt;88,000 visits) with new prescriptions for hydrocodone-acetaminophen were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive either usual care or the educational intervention. The educational intervention was a one-page information sheet about hydrocodone-acetaminophen, which was both given to the patients and read aloud by the research assistant (nonblinded). Follow-up phone calls were conducted 4 to 7 days after the visit to assess patient knowledge about the medication and self-report of activities associated with safety of use (e.g., double-dipping with acetaminophen, storage, use with alcohol or while driving).RESULTS: A total of 274 patients were enrolled; 210 completed follow-up (110 usual care and 100 intervention). No significant differences in baseline characteristics emerged between the study arms; 42% were male, and 51% were white, with a median age of 43 years. Half of patients had non-back pain orthopedic injuries (49.5%). On follow-up, overall knowledge was poor, with only 28% able to name both active ingredients in the medication. The intervention group had better knowledge of precautions related to taking additional acetaminophen (usual care 18.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.9% to 25.5% vs. intervention 38%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 47.7%; difference = 27.6, 95% CI of difference = 21.5 to 33.7) and knowledge of side effects (usual care median = 1, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 2 vs. intervention median = 2, IQR = 1 to 2; p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, those who received the intervention were less likely to have reported driving within 6 hours after taking hydrocodone (usual care 13.6%, 95% CI = 7.2% to 20% vs. intervention 3%, 95% CI = -0.3% to 6.3%; difference = 10.6, 95% CI of difference = 3.4 to 17.9). There was no difference between groups related to knowledge about drinking alcohol while taking hydrocodone (overall 18.1%) or knowledge that the opioid could be addictive (overall 72.4%).CONCLUSIONS: This simple strategy improved several, but not all, aspects of patient knowledge and resulted in fewer patients in the intervention arm driving while taking hydrocodone. Integration of a patient education document into conversations about opioids holds promise for improving patient knowledge about these high-risk medications.","The Department of Emergency Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.",2015,10.1111/acem.12600

Reducing their consumption will likely be beneficial for society as a whole. Computer and web-based interventions are promising for providing behaviorally based information. The present study compared the efficacy of three interventions (computerized screening and motivational intervention [ASSIST/MBIc], non-computerized screening and motivational intervention [ASSIST/MBIi], and screening only [control]) in college students in Curitiba, Brazil. A convenience sample of 458 students scored moderate and high risk on the ASSIST. They were then randomized into the three arms of the randomized controlled trial (ASSIST/MBIc, ASSIST/MBIi [interview], and assessment-only [control]) and assessed at baseline and 3 months later. The ASSIST involvement scores decreased at follow-up compared with baseline in the three groups, suggesting that any intervention is better than no intervention. For alcohol, the specific involvement scores decreased to a low level of risk in the three groups and the MBIc group showed a positive outcome compared with control, and the scores for each question were reduced in the two intervention groups compared to baseline. For tobacco, involvement scores decreased in the three groups, but they maintained moderate risk. For marijuana, a small positive effect was observed in the ASSIST/MBIi and control groups. The ASSIST/MBIc may be a good alternative to interview interventions because it is easy to administer, students frequently use such computer-based technologies, and individually tailored content can be delivered in the absence of a counselor.","Department of Pharmacology, Universidade Federal do Paraná, Jardim das Américas, Curitiba, Paraná 81531-990, Brazil.

44,,25675861,An observational study of buprenorphine treatment of the prescription opioid dependent pain patient.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In some countries, particularly the United States and Canada, there has been a growing problem of opioid dependence associated with the treatment of chronic pain. Controversy exists regarding the efficacy and safety of opioid therapy, particularly in high doses for extended periods of time. This study reports on the outcome of chronic pain patients treated with buprenorphine in an outpatient psychiatric consultation clinic.METHODS: Forty three consecutive outpatient clinic chronic pain patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of opioid dependence and treated with buprenorphine during a 3-year period were monitored for follow-up periods of up to 5 years. All subjects were dependent on drugs prescribed for pain and were divided into two groups: those who had a history of abuse of alcohol or drugs and those who did not Historical, physical, demographic, and outcome data were collected.RESULTS: The majority of patients were male, not working, and between the ages of 45-60. Follow-up revealed that treatment with buprenorphine was effective. Most patients had improved pain with treatment of the opioid dependence. There were no differences between those with or without a history of substance abuse.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients often improved with much less preoccupation with pain, expressing great satisfaction with buprenorphine treatment.SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Buprenorphine is an effective tool when treating the opioid-dependent chronic pain patient.","Department of Psychiatry, University of Hawaii, School of Medicine, Honolulu, Hawaii; The Queen's Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii.",2015,10.1111/ajad.12198
45,,25675651,Patient profile and treatment satisfaction of Brazilian leprosy patients in a clinical trial of uniform six-month multidrug therapy (U-MDT/CT-BR).,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of patients who participated in the Randomised Clinical Trial for Uniform Multidrug Therapy for Leprosy Patients in Brazil (U-MDT/CT-BR) and determine the level of satisfaction with a uniform therapy regimen, especially among paucibacillary patients.DESIGN: This is a descriptive cross-sectional epidemiologic study nested in the wider U-MDT/CT-BR. The study was conducted using a convenience sample composed of patients from the Dona Libânia Dermatology Centre in Fortaleza, Ceará and from the Alfredo da Matta Foundation in Manaus, Amazonas in Brazil. The absolute and relative frequencies of categorical variables and the median age were calculated. Hypothesis testing was done using the Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests with a 0.05 level of significance.RESULTS: Of the 859 patients included in the clinical trial, 342 were interviewed. The majority of patients were male (58.2%) and multibacillary (78.3%) with a median age of 42 (7-65) years. Most of the interviewees had not completed primary education (48.0%), earned an income below three times the minimum wage (53.8%), were non-smokers (85.1%), did not regularly consume alcohol (88.3%), had not experienced any leprosy-related discrimination (69.2%) and showed a basic knowledge of the disease. With regards to paucibacillary patients, 87.8% and 90.9% of the PB U-MDT and PB R-MDT groups, respectively, indicated that they had not thought of defaulting treatment at any time. On a satisfaction scale of 1-5 (with five as the highest score), 92.7% of PB U-MDT and 100.0% of PB R-MDT patients gave a mark between three and five.CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the introduction of clofazimine into the therapeutic regimen did not diminish the level of treatment satisfaction among PB patients.",NA,2015,NA

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that primary care physicians screen patients for such hazardous alcohol use, and when warranted, deliver a brief intervention.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine primary care residents' current practices, perceived barriers and confidence with conducting alcohol screening and brief interventions (SBI).DESIGN: This was a multi-site, cross-sectional survey conducted from March 2010 through December 2012.PARTICIPANTS: We invited all residents in six primary care residency programs (three internal medicine programs and three family medicine programs) to participate. Of 244 residents, 210 completed the survey (response rate 86 %).MAIN MEASURES: Our survey assessed residents' alcohol screening practices (instruments used and frequency of screening), perceived barriers to discussing alcohol, brief intervention content, and self-rated ability to help hazardous drinkers. To determine the quality of brief interventions delivered, we examined how often residents reported including the three key recommended elements of feedback, advice, and goal-setting.KEY RESULTS: Most residents (60 %, 125/208) reported &quot;usually&quot; or &quot;always&quot; screening patients for alcohol misuse at the initial clinic visit, but few residents routinely screened patients at subsequent acute-care (17 %, 35/208) or chronic-care visits (33 %, 68/208). Only 19 % (39/210) of residents used screening instruments capable of detecting binge drinking. The most frequently reported barrier to SBI was lack of adequate training (54 %, 108/202), and only 21 % (43/208) of residents felt confident they could help at -risk drinkers. When residents did perform a brief intervention, only 24 % (49/208) &quot;usually&quot; or &quot;always&quot; included the three recommended elements.CONCLUSIONS: A minority of residents in this multi-site study appropriately screen or intervene with at-risk alcohol users. To equip residents to effectively address hazardous alcohol use, there is a critical need for educational and clinic interventions to support alcohol-related SBI.","Department of Internal Medicine, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC, USA, kle@wakehealth.edu.",2015,10.1007/s11606-015-3184-y
47,,25638351,Smoking cessation and care management for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness and mortality in the United States. Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) have smoking rates higher than that of others and fewer individuals with PTSD have quit smoking. This randomized controlled trial was designed to test the effectiveness of integrating telehealth care management and smoking cessation with motivational interviewing for Veterans with PTSD.DESIGN: All smokers with PTSD, regardless of their desire to quit, were invited to participate. Enrollment occurred between November 2009 and April 2013. Target enrollment was 120 participants. Enrolled participants were randomized to either the control group, receiving usual care including a telehealth PTSD program, with a device that delivered PTSD information and in-home care management, or the intervention group, which included (1) a telehealth PTSD program, (2) motivational interviewing-based smoking cessation curricula via the telehealth device, and (3) weekly motivational interviewing counseling phone calls. Outcomes are self-reported 24-hour quit attempts, progression along the stages of change and 7-day point prevalence quit smoking rates for the intervention group compared to usual care alone. Secondary outcomes include participants' perception of care coordination, patient satisfaction with motivational interviewing, PTSD symptoms, pain, depression and quality of life.DISCUSSION: Motivational interviewing has been shown to increase readiness for change and smoking cessation care has been shown to be more successful when incorporated into in-person mental health care. Our study builds on previous studies. It integrates a written smoking cessation curriculum and phone-based motivational interviewing counseling into an established PTSD home telehealth care coordination program.

48,,25623412,"Preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancy among an American Indian/Alaska Native population: effect of a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment intervention.","BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California.METHODS: Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months postintervention.RESULTS: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p &lt; 0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p = 0.017 and risk of AEP p &lt; 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and depression/impaired functionality.CONCLUSIONS: Participation in assessment alone may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may have implications for future interventions.","Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California; Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, San Diego, California.",2015,10.1111/acer.12607
49,,25619671,Risk factors for alcohol relapse following orthotopic liver transplantation: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: Each year, 5000-6000 individuals undergo orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the United States, and of these, nearly 18% have alcoholic liver disease. Relapse to alcohol occurs in more than 40% of patients with OLT for alcoholic liver disease.OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify factors that predict relapse to alcohol or medication nonadherence following OLT in patients with alcoholic liver disease and to review what randomized clinical interventions have addressed these factors following OLT. Our hypothesis was that there would be factors before and after OLT that predict relapse to alcohol following OLT, and that these, if targeted, might improve sobriety and associated outcomes of adherence with medications and appointments.METHODS: We performed a review (focusing on articles published since 2004) with PubMed and MEDLINE searches using the following search terms: liver transplantation, recidivism, alcohol relapse, and predictors of alcohol relapse. We supplemented the online searches with manual reviews of article reference lists and selected relevant articles for further review by author consensus.RESULTS: In largely white populations, prospective studies document that shorter length of pretransplantation sobriety is a significant predictor of time to first drink and time to binge use. Presence of psychiatric comorbidity, high score on standardized High-risk Alcoholism Relapse Scale, and diagnosis of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) alcohol dependence are predictive of posttransplantation alcohol relapse. Pretransplantation alcohol use history variables (e.g., family history of alcoholism) reliably discriminate between complete abstainers and those who drink, while medical and psychosocial characteristics at early post-liver transplantation period (e.g., more bodily pain) maximally discriminate patterns of alcohol use. Alcoholic individuals with early-onset, rapidly accelerating moderate use and early-onset, continuously increasing heavy use have more than double the prevalence of steatohepatitis or rejection on biopsy and graft failure and more frequent mortality resulting from recurrent alcoholic liver disease than late-onset (i.e., peak of heaviest drinking at 6y posttransplantation) alcohol users do. Fortunately, pretransplantation screening combined with a structured pretransplantation management program and a 12-step program attendance reduced recidivism. No randomized clinical trials have been performed that target pretransplantation risk factors in individuals with alcoholic liver disease before or after OLT to improve post-OLT outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Recent research findings suggest that screening can reveal individuals who are vulnerable to alcohol relapse and targeted intervention can prevent their relapse to alcohol. Based on existing addiction treatments (e.g., relapse prevention plan construction), randomized clinical trials tailored to post-OLT patients should be conducted to improve their survival and quality of life.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neurosciences, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine, Tampa, FL (JKR).

Articles were identified for full-text review based on a screening of titles and abstracts and were excluded during this initial review if they focused on environmental exposures in the following populations: 1) Indigenous populations, 2) individuals &amp;lt;15 years of age, 3) pregnant women and associated negative birth outcomes, or 4) non-Canadian populations. Articles were also excluded if the primary focus was on exposures to environmental tobacco smoke, non-chemical occupational hazards, infectious diseases, noise and/or radiation. A full-text review of 78 identified articles systematically assessed how sex/gender and race/ethnicity were considered.SYNTHESIS: Although 59% of studies stratified results by sex, less than half of these offered any explanation of differential exposures. Eighteen of the 78 studies (23%) used terms related to race/ethnicity in their participant descriptions. Of the studies that conducted subgroup analyses of exposure results by race/ethnicity (n=15), a total of 8 also included subgroup analysis by sex.

51,,25533866,Health promotion interventions and policies addressing excessive alcohol use: a systematic review of national and global evidence as a guide to health-care reform in China.,"AIMS: Steady increases in alcohol consumption and related problems are likely to accompany China's rapid epidemiological transition and profit-based marketing activities. We reviewed research on health promotion interventions and policies to address excessive drinking and to guide health-care reform.METHODS: We searched Chinese- and English-language databases and included 21 studies in China published between 1980 and 2013 that covered each policy area from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol. We evaluated and compared preventive interventions to the global alcohol literature for cross-national applicability.RESULTS: In contrast with hundreds of studies in the global literature, 11 of 12 studies from mainland China were published in Chinese; six of 10 in English were on taxation from Taiwan or Hong Kong. Most studies demonstrated effectiveness in reducing excessive drinking, and some reported the reduction of health problems. Seven were randomized controlled trials. Studies targeted schools, drink-driving, work-places, the health sector and taxation.CONCLUSIONS: China is the world's largest alcohol market, yet there has been little growth in alcohol policy research related to health promotion interventions over the past decade. Guided by a public health approach, the WHO Global Strategy and health reform experience in Russia, Australia, Mexico and the United States, China could improve its public health response through better coordination and implementation of surveillance and evidence-based research, and through programmatic and legal responses such as public health law research, screening and early intervention within health systems and the implementation of effective alcohol control strategies.","Michigan State University, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, East Lansing, MI, USA; San Diego State University, Graduate School of Public Health, Center for Behavioral Epidemiology and Community Health, San Diego, CA, USA.",2014,10.1111/add.12784
52,,25506771,Proactive tobacco cessation outreach to smokers of low socioeconomic status: a randomized clinical trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Widening socioeconomic disparities in mortality in the United States are largely explained by slower declines in tobacco use among smokers of low socioeconomic status (SES) than among those of higher SES, which points to the need for targeted tobacco cessation interventions. Documentation of smoking status in electronic health records (EHRs) provides the tools for health systems to proactively offer tobacco treatment to socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a proactive tobacco cessation strategy that addresses sociocontextual mediators of tobacco use for low-SES smokers.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized clinical trial included low-SES adult smokers who described their race and/or ethnicity as black, Hispanic, or white and received primary care at 1 of 13 practices in the greater Boston area (intervention group, n = 399; control group, n = 308).INTERVENTIONS: We analyzed EHRs to identify potentially eligible participants and then used interactive voice response (IVR) techniques to reach out to them. Consenting patients were randomized to either receive usual care from their own health care team or enter an intervention program that included (1) telephone-based motivational counseling, (2) free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 6 weeks, (3) access to community-based referrals to address sociocontextual mediators of tobacco use, and (4) integration of all these components into their normal health care through the EHR system.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported past-7-day tobacco abstinence 9 months after randomization (&quot;quitting&quot;), assessed by automated caller or blinded study staff.RESULTS: The intervention group had a higher quit rate than the usual care group (17.8% vs 8.1%; odds ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.0; number needed to treat, 10). We examined whether use of intervention components was associated with quitting among individuals in the intervention group: individuals who participated in the telephone counseling were more likely to quit than those who did not (21.2% vs 10.4%; P &lt; .001). There was no difference in quitting by use of NRT. Quitting did not differ by a request for a community referral, but individuals who used their referral were more likely to quit than those who did not (43.6% vs 15.3%; P &lt; .001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Proactive, IVR-facilitated outreach enables engagement with low-SES smokers.

53,,25500989,Barriers and promoters of an evidenced-based smoking cessation counseling during prenatal care in Argentina and Uruguay.,"In Argentina and Uruguay, 10.3 and 18.3 %, respectively, of pregnant women smoked in 2005. Brief cessation counseling, based on the 5A's model, has been effective in different settings. This qualitative study aims to improve the understanding of factors influencing the provision of smoking cessation counseling during pregnancy in Argentina and Uruguay. In 2010, we obtained prenatal care providers', clinic directors', and pregnant smokers' opinions regarding barriers and promoters to brief smoking cessation counseling in publicly-funded prenatal care clinics in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay. We interviewed six prenatal clinic directors, conducted focus groups with 46 health professionals and 24 pregnant smokers. Themes emerged from three issue areas: health professionals, health system, and patients. Health professional barriers to cessation counseling included inadequate knowledge and motivation, perceived low self-efficacy, and concerns about inadequate time and large workload. They expressed interest in obtaining a counseling script. Health system barriers included low prioritization of smoking cessation and a lack of clinic protocols to implement interventions. Pregnant smokers lacked information on the risks of prenatal smoking and underestimated the difficulty of smoking cessation. Having access to written materials and receiving cessation services during clinic waiting times were mentioned as promoters for the intervention. Women also were receptive to non-physician office staff delivering intervention components. Implementing smoking cessation counseling in publicly-funded prenatal care clinics in Argentina and Uruguay may require integrating counseling into routine prenatal care and educating and training providers on best-practices approaches.","Unidad de Investigación Clínica y Epidemiológica Montevideo, Hosp Clinicas, Av Italia s/n, Montevideo, Uruguay, mcolomar@unicem-web.org.",2014,10.1007/s10995-014-1652-3
54,,25479908,High-risk population in sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: guidelines for screening.,"BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most deadly forms of cancer in the United States, with an annual incidence to death ratio of 0.92 because of the late stage at diagnosis. Identification of high-risk individuals (HRIs) that would be ideal for screening is needed to identify precursor lesions and small early stage disease. Those with a genetic predisposition have largely been identified, but little is known about those at high-risk for sporadic PC. This study asserts that a high-risk population does exist in sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and proposes simple guidelines for screening.METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of the literature regarding identification of and screening in high-risk groups.RESULTS: Those with the highest genetic risk of developing PC include those with hereditary pancreatitis (87 times more likely at age 55), Peutz-Jehgers syndrome (132 times more likely at age 50), p16-Leiden mutations (48 times more likely), and familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) kindreds (32 times more likely). Those with the highest risk of developing sporadic PC include those with new-onset diabetes older than 50 y and smoking history.CONCLUSIONS: Given that sporadic PC is the single largest patient population effected with this devastating disease, some form of screening should be initiated. Currently, the medical community does nothing to attempt early detection of PC. However, sufficient evidence now exists to begin a screening protocol in a high-risk cohort, which would be patients with new-onset diabetes older than 50 y and a smoking history.","Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky.",2014,10.1016/j.jss.2014.06.046

To address this disparity, we recruited Latino couples into a randomized controlled trial and provided a smoking cessation program during a teachable moment, when men's partners were pregnant.METHODS: We compared two interventions: (i) written materials plus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to (ii) materials, NRT, and couple-based counseling that addressed smoking cessation and couples communication. We recruited 348 expectant fathers who smoked via their pregnant partners from county health departments. Our primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence and was collected from November 2010 through April 2013 and analyzed in February 2014.RESULTS: We found high rates of cessation but no arm differences in smoking rates at the end of pregnancy (0.31 vs. 0.30, materials only vs. counseling, respectively) and 12 months after randomization (postpartum: 0.39 vs. 0.38). We found high quit rates among nondaily smokers but no arm differences (0.43 vs. 0.46 in pregnancy and 0.52 vs. 0.48 postpartum). Among daily smokers, we found lower quit rates with no arm differences but effects favoring the intervention arm (0.13 vs. 0.16 in pregnancy and 0.17 vs. 0.24 postpartum).CONCLUSIONS: A less intensive intervention promoted cessation equal to more intensive counseling. Postpartum might be a more powerful time to promote cessation among Latino men.IMPACT: Less intensive interventions when delivered during teachable moments for Latino men could result in a high smoking cessation rate and could reduce disparities.","Cancer Control and Population Science, Duke Cancer Institute, Durham, North Carolina.

56,,25398462,Unintentional child neglect: literature review and observational study.,"Child abuse is a problem that affects over six million children in the United States each year. Child neglect accounts for 78% of those cases. Despite this, the issue of child neglect is still not well understood, partially because child neglect does not have a consistent, universally accepted definition. Some researchers consider child neglect and child abuse to be one in the same, while other researchers consider them to be conceptually different. Factors that make child neglect difficult to define include: (1) Cultural differences; motives must be taken into account because parents may believe they are acting in the child's best interests based on cultural beliefs (2) the fact that the effect of child abuse is not always immediately visible; the effects of emotional neglect specifically may not be apparent until later in the child's development, and (3) the large spectrum of actions that fall under the category of child abuse. Some of the risk factors for increased child neglect and maltreatment have been identified. These risk factors include socioeconomic status, education level, family composition, and the presence of dysfunction family characteristics. Studies have found that children from poorer families and children of less educated parents are more likely to sustain fatal unintentional injuries than children of wealthier, better educated parents. Studies have also found that children living with adults unrelated to them are at increased risk for unintentional injuries and maltreatment. Dysfunctional family characteristics may even be more indicative of child neglect. Parental alcohol or drug abuse, parental personal history of neglect, and parental stress greatly increase the odds of neglect. Parental depression doubles the odds of child neglect. However, more research needs to be done to better understand these risk factors and to identify others. Having a clearer understanding of the risk factors could lead to prevention and treatment, as it would allow for health care personnel to screen for high-risk children and intervene before it is too late. Screening could also be done in the schools and organized after school activities. Parenting classes have been shown to be an effective intervention strategy by decreasing parental stress and potential for abuse, but there has been limited research done on this approach. Parenting classes can be part of the corrective actions for parents found to be neglectful or abusive, but parenting classes may also be useful as a preventative measure, being taught in schools or readily available in higher-risk communities. More research has to be done to better define child abuse and neglect so that it can be effectively addressed and treated.","Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, 19107, USA, emilybeth.friedman@gmail.com.",2014,10.1007/s11126-014-9328-0
57,,25331545,The effectiveness of helplines for the treatment of alcohol and illicit substance use.,"While tobacco helplines (quitlines) are thought to be effective, helplines which treat other substance use do not have an established evidence base. A review was conducted of the literature on illicit drug or alcohol (IDA) helplines. The literature search was conducted in five databases. Studies prior to 2014 were included if published in English, and involved the use of a telephone counselling helpline for the treatment of illicit drug or alcohol use. Review papers, opinion pieces, letters or editorials, case studies, published abstracts and posters were excluded. Initial searching identified 2178 articles and after removing duplicates and those meeting the exclusion criteria, there were 36 publications for review. A total of 29 articles provided descriptive information about 19 different IDA helplines which operated in the US (42%), Europe (21%), Australia (21%), Asia (11%) and Canada (5%). These services reported monthly call rates from 3.7 to over 23,000 calls per month. A total of nine articles provided evaluative information on eight different IDA helplines: four articles included a comparison of treatment outcomes against a control group and five articles included information on treatment satisfaction or service utilisation. Together they provide some evidence that these services are effective. Although there was little consistency in the measures used between articles which assessed helpline satisfaction, all but one reported high satisfaction. Although the evidence is mainly supportive of IDA helplines, further work is required to compare treatment outcomes in randomized groups.","National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia p.gates@unsw.edu.",2014,10.1177/1357633X14555643
58,,25242554,A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco use and prostate cancer mortality and incidence in prospective cohort studies.,"CONTEXT: An association between tobacco smoking and prostate cancer (PCa) incidence and mortality was suggested in an earlier meta-analysis of 24 prospective studies in which dose-response associations and risks per unit of tobacco use were not examined.OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between several measures of tobacco use and PCa mortality (primary outcome) and incidence (secondary outcome) including dose-response association.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Relevant articles from prospective studies were identified by searching the PubMed and Web of Science databases (through January 21, 2014) and reference lists of relevant articles. Combined relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects methods. We also calculated population attributable risk (PAR) for smoking and PCa mortality.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 51 articles in this meta-analysis (11823 PCa deaths, 50349 incident cases, and 4,082,606 cohort participants). Current cigarette smoking was associated with an increased risk of PCa death (RR: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18-1.31), with little evidence for heterogeneity and publication bias. The number of cigarettes smoked per day had a dose-response association with PCa mortality (p=0.02; RR for 20 cigarettes per day: 1.20). The PAR for cigarette smoking and PCa deaths in the United States and Europe were 6.7% and 9.5%, respectively, corresponding to &gt;10000 deaths/year in these two regions. Current cigarette smoking was inversely associated with incident PCa (RR: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96), with high heterogeneity in the results. However, in studies completed in 1995 or earlier (considered as completed before the prostate-specific antigen screening era), ever smoking showed a positive association with incident PCa (RR: 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00-1.12) with little heterogeneity.CONCLUSIONS: Combined evidence from observational studies shows a modest but statistically significant association between cigarette smoking and fatal PCa.

59,,25216877,Improving outcomes for diverse populations disproportionately affected by diabetes: final results of Project IMPACT: Diabetes.,"OBJECTIVE: To improve key indicators of diabetes care by expanding a proven community-based model of care throughout high-risk areas in the United States.DESIGN: Observational, multisite, pre-post comparison study.SETTING: Federally qualified health centers, free clinics, employer worksites, community pharmacies, departments of health, physician offices, and other care facilities in 25 communities in 17 states from June 2011 through January 2013.PARTICIPANTS: 1,836 patients disproportionately affected by diabetes representing diverse ethnicities, insurance statuses, and social and economic backgrounds.INTERVENTION: Pharmacists were integrated into local, interdisciplinary diabetes care teams and provided customized diabetes education and medication consultations to patients.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical measures included glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Process measures included smoking status, eye examination status, foot examination status, and influenza vaccine status.RESULTS: Pharmacist patient care services for those underserved or disproportionately affected by diabetes resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant decrease in mean A1C levels (-0.8%). Other outcome indicators were below target levels at baseline and decreased significantly but not by clinically relevant amounts (LDL-C, -7.1 mg/dL; triglycerides, -23.7 mg/dL, and total cholesterol, -8.8 mg/dL). The mean increase in HDL-C (+0.6 mg/dL) was not statistically significant or clinically relevant. Among evaluable patients who were not at target for process measures at baseline, 51.7% of 453 patients received eye examinations, 72.0% of 271 patients received foot examinations, 41.7% of 307 patients received influenza vaccinations, and 9.3% patients of 270 quit smoking during the project. Of the communities involved in the study, 92% intend to sustain pharmacists' services.CONCLUSION: ProjectIMPACT: Diabetes results show significant improvement in patients' clinical outcomes and demonstrate that all patients, even those with tremendous barriers to appropriate diabetes care, benefit from patient-centered, interdisciplinary health care teams that include pharmacists.",NA,2014,10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13240
60,,25208203,"Gender differences in the developmental risk of onset of alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana use and the effects of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol outcomes.","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (a) characterize gender-specific risk of onset of alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana use developmentally; (b) investigate the effects of early-onset status and frequency of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol outcomes, controlling for the effects of alcohol use; and (c) examine gender differences in the developmental trajectories of alcohol outcomes and the effects of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol outcomes.METHOD: This study conducted secondary analysis on a longitudinal study that recruited at-risk youth through fathers' drunk-driving records and door-to-door canvassing in the midwestern United States. The sample included 160 female-male sibling pairs who were assessed on substance use and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis from early childhood to young adulthood.RESULTS: Although males were at higher risk for being early-onset alcohol users, females tended to be at higher risk for initiating marijuana use at younger ages. When early onset and amount of alcohol use were controlled for, early onset of nicotine and marijuana use did not contribute to alcohol outcomes, but frequencies of nicotine and marijuana use did. We also found the associations of quantity/frequency of alcohol and marijuana use with drinking problems to be stronger among females than among males.CONCLUSIONS: Higher frequencies of nicotine and marijuana use may contribute to worse alcohol outcomes above and beyond the effect of alcohol use. Females tend to be at higher risk than males for initiating marijuana use and meeting an alcohol use disorder diagnosis at younger ages as well as being more vulnerable to a negative impact of alcohol and marijuana use.","Addiction Research Center and Substance Abuse Program, Department of Psychiatry, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.",2014,NA

The scope of this paper is to analyze differences in alcohol and drug consumption, as well as on behavior associated with traffic accidents among men and women. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 609 sequential traffic accident victims attended in emergency care from Porto Alegre. Subjects gave a structured interview, were breathalyzed and had a saliva test for alcohol/drug screening. Results showed that women were mainly passengers or pedestrians (p &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in positive blood alcohol concentration. However, men reported more binge drinking and THC use, while women had more benzodiazepine in their saliva (p&lt;0.05). This is the first Brazilian study to compare alcohol and drug use among men and women who were the victims of traffic accidents. Results point to differences in the pattern of substance abuse, as well on risk behavior.

In the setting of a cross-national trial, we aimed to compare efficacy of sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy in the United States (US) and Canada.METHODS: In the clinical trial Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy for A1C Reduction (STAR 3), 329 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomly allocated to either SAP or glargine-based multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy at 26 US sites (n=271) and 4 Canadian sites (n=58). A bootstrap analysis was performed to confirm significant differences in baseline characteristics. For the primary analysis, we compared the baseline to 1-year change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) between Canadian and US subjects.RESULTS: At baseline, compared with US subjects, Canadian subjects were more likely to be students (19% vs. 7%, p&lt;0.01) and to consume alcohol (91% vs. 63%, p&lt;0.01). Although Canadian subjects had greater A1C reductions from baseline compared with US subjects (p=0.02), the incremental benefit of SAP was similar in the US (SAP compared with MDI, -0.93%±0.73% vs. -0.31%±0.81%, p&lt;0.001) and Canada (-1.14%±0.72% vs. -0.67%±0.71%, p&lt;0.001). Mean sensor use was significantly higher in Canada than in the US (79% vs. 68% of the time, p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in baseline characteristics and sensor adherence, SAP efficacy was similar between US and Canadian participants. As long as the intervention is administered with a similar level of expertise as was conducted in the trial, it is likely to be applicable in diverse clinical practice settings.","Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

However, it is not a recommended universal preventive service in primary care because of lack of evidence of efficacy.OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of 2 brief counseling interventions for unhealthy drug use (any illicit drug use or prescription drug misuse)-a brief negotiated interview (BNI) and an adaptation of motivational interviewing (MOTIV)-compared with no brief intervention.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-group randomized trial took place at an urban hospital-based primary care internal medicine practice; 528 adult primary care patients with drug use (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test [ASSIST] substance-specific scores of ≥4) were identified by screening between June 2009 and January 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts.INTERVENTIONS: Two interventions were tested: the BNI is a 10- to 15-minute structured interview conducted by health educators; the MOTIV is a 30- to 45-minute intervention based on motivational interviewing with a 20- to 30-minute booster conducted by master's-level counselors. All study participants received a written list of substance use disorder treatment and mutual help resources.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was number of days of use in the past 30 days of the self-identified main drug as determined by a validated calendar method at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included other self-reported measures of drug use, drug use according to hair testing, ASSIST scores (severity), drug use consequences, unsafe sex, mutual help meeting attendance, and health care utilization.RESULTS: At baseline, 63% of participants reported their main drug was marijuana, 19% cocaine, and 17% opioids. At 6 months, 98% completed follow-up. Mean adjusted number of days using the main drug at 6 months was 12 for no brief intervention vs 11 for the BNI group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.22) and 12 for the MOTIV group (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.32; P = .81 for both comparisons vs no brief intervention). There were also no significant effects of BNI or MOTIV on any other outcome or in analyses stratified by main drug or drug use severity.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Brief intervention did not have efficacy for decreasing unhealthy drug use in primary care patients identified by screening.

64,,24975881,Environmental characteristics associated with alcohol intoxication among patrons in Brazilian nightclubs.,"INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the association between environmental factors and patrons' binge drinking in nightclubs, and such studies are rare in developing countries.OBJECTIVE: To identify environmental factors associated with binge drinking among patrons in nightclubs in São Paulo, Brazil, using a mixed-methods design.METHOD: The study used a two-stage cluster sampling survey design. Two levels of data were collected: observational data and portal survey data. Individual-level data were collected by a portal survey of 2422 subjects at the entrance and 1822 subjects at the exit of 31 nightclubs. Weighted multilevel analysis was used to investigate the association between patrons' binge drinking (as measured by breath alcohol concentration ≥0.38 mg L(-1) ) at nightclub exit, with environmental-level variables collected through observation and controlled for individual-level data.RESULTS: Pre-drinking was the variable most strongly associated with binge drinking BrAC levels when exiting the venue [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) [4.37, 8.17], P &lt; 0.001). The environmental variables significantly associated with binge drinking were 'all you can drink' service (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI [1.03, 0.79]; P = 0.043), two or more dance floors (aOR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.16, 3.18]; P = 0.011), and higher sound levels (aOR = 1.04 per each decibel increased, 95% CI [1.01, 1.08]; P = 0.048). Data triangulation showed an association between lower alcohol intoxication and ketamine use in three LGBT nightclubs.DISCUSSION: Pre-drinking showed that individual-level characteristics could be more important in binge drinking than the venues' environmental characteristics. Previous studies failed to include pre-drinking in environmental analysis.CONCLUSION: Environmental control interventions, isolated from individual-level approaches, may have limited efficacy in the prevention of alcohol abuse in nightclubs.","Department of Preventive Medicine, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil.",2014,10.1111/dar.12155

Medical records were reviewed and adherence scale, assessment of caregivers' quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), anxiety, depression, and alcohol/substances use/abuse were assessed. Outcomes included self-reported 100% adherence in the last three days and HIV viral load (VL)&lt;50 copies/mL. Statistical analyses included contingency tables and respective statistics, and multivariable logistic regression.RESULTS: 260 subjects were enrolled: 78% children and 22% adolescents; 93% of caregivers for the children and 77% of adolescents reported 100% adherence; 57% of children and 49% of adolescents had VL&lt;50 copies/mL. In the univariate analyses, HIV diagnosis for screening due to maternal infection, lower caregiver scores for anxiety, and higher scores in physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL-BREF were associated with 100% adherence. Shorter intervals between pharmacy visits were associated with VL&lt;50 copies/mL (p ≤ 0.01). Multivariable regression demonstrated that caregivers who did not abuse alcohol/other drugs (OR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.27-0.89) and median interval between pharmacy visits&lt;33 days (OR=0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.98) were independently associated with VL&lt;50 copies/mL; whereas lower caregiver scores for anxiety (OR=2.57; 95% CI: 1.27-5.19) and children's HIV diagnosis for screening due to maternal infection (OR=2.25; 95% CI: 1.12-4.50) were found to be independently associated with 100% adherence.CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric HIV programs should perform routine assessment of caregivers' quality of life, and anxiety and depression symptoms.

The current study compared self-reported drug use on the ASSIST with laboratory analysis of hair samples using a standard commercially available 5-panel test with assay screening and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) confirmation. Both self-report and hair testing covered a 3-month period.RESULTS: Overall concordance between hair testing and self-report was 57.5% (marijuana), 86.5% (cocaine), 85.8% (amphetamines), and 74.3% (opioids). Specificity of hair testing at standard laboratory cut-offs exceeded 90% for all drugs, but sensitivity of hair testing relative to self-report was low, identifying only 52.3% (127/243) of self-disclosed marijuana users, 65.2% (30/46) of cocaine users, 24.2% (8/33) of amphetamine users, and 2.9% (2/68) of opioid users. Among participants who disclosed using marijuana or cocaine in the past 3 months, participants with a negative hair test tended to report lower-frequency use of those drugs (p&lt;.001 for marijuana and cocaine).CONCLUSIONS: Hair testing can be useful in studies with moderate-risk drug users, but the potential for under-identification of low-frequency use suggests that researchers should consider employing low detection cut-offs and using hair testing in conjunction with self-report.","Friends Research Institute, Inc., 1040 Park Avenue, Suite 103, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.

Financial coverage for these medications increases utilization of pharmacotherapies. This study assesses whether financial coverage increases the proportion of successful quitters.METHODS: A pragmatic, open-label, randomized, controlled trial was conducted in 58 Canadian sites between March 2009 and September 2010. Smokers (≥10 cigarettes/day) without insurance coverage who were motivated to quit within 14 days were randomized (1:1) in a blinded manner to receive either full coverage eligibility for 26 weeks or no coverage. Pharmacotherapies covered were varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patches/gum. Investigators/subjects were unblinded to study group assignment after randomization and prior to choosing a smoking cessation method(s). All subjects received brief smoking cessation counseling. The primary outcome measure was self-reported 7-day point prevalence of abstinence (PPA) at week 26.RESULTS: Of the 1380 randomized subjects (coverage, 696; no coverage, 684), 682 (98.0%) and 435 (63.6%), respectively, were dispensed at least one smoking cessation medication dose. The 7-day PPA at week 26 was higher in the full coverage versus no coverage group: 20.8% (n = 145) and 13.9% (n = 95), respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.18; p = 0.001. Urine cotinine-confirmed 7-day PPA at week 26 was 15.7% (n = 109) and 10.1% (n = 69), respectively; OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.33; p = 0.002. After pharmacotherapy, coverage eligibility was withdrawn from the full coverage group, continuous abstinence between weeks 26 and 52 was 6.6% (n = 46) and 5.6% (n = 38), in the full coverage and no coverage groups, respectively; OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.76-1.87; p = 0.439.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the adoption of a smoking cessation medication coverage drug policy was an effective intervention to improve 26-week quit rates in Canada. The advantages were lost once coverage was discontinued. Further study is required on the duration of coverage to prevent relapse to smoking.

The PUMA study (Prevalencia y práctica habitUal -diagnóstico y tratamiento- en población de riesgo de EPOC en Médicos generalistas de 4 países de América Latina) screened at-risk patients attending primary care centers to evaluate the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of COPD in this setting. The aim of this report is to describe the study methodology.METHODS: Multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study conducted in Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela. Subjects were≥40 years, smokers, former smokers and/or exposed to fossil fuels attending primary care centers. Eligible patients underwent pre- and post- bronchodilator spirometry and completed standardized questionnaires on demographics, smoking, exposure to environmental/domestic pollution, symptoms/history and management of respiratory diseases, comorbidities, and use of healthcare resources.RESULTS: A total of 57 centers in 4 countries participated; 1,907 patients were included, 1,743 completed the PUMA questionnaire and 1,540 patients underwent validated spirometry.CONCLUSIONS: We describe the methodology used in the PUMA study, the first systematic multicenter study in four Latin American countries aimed at detecting COPD cases confirmed by spirometry in primary care. Approximately 90% of patients who completed the PUMA questionnaire underwent valid spirometry tests. This gives room for reflection on the feasibility of opportunistic screening at the primary care level to detect patients in the early stages of COPD or with undiagnosed COPD, and improve the diagnosis and management of this disease.","Dirección, Hospital de Rehabilitación Respiratoria «María Ferrer», Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Our objective was to provide primary health care providers with insight into the needs of pregnant patients with high behavioral health risks to serve them better during the critical window of opportunity for long-term impact. We conducted cross-sectional secondary analysis of baseline data from women enrolled in treatment programs in the Women, Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study from nine sites across the United States. We used analysis of variance and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical analyses to compare means and frequencies of social vulnerability indicators and baseline Addiction Severity Index, Brief Symptom Inventory of mental health, and Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale scores between 152 pregnant and 2,577 nonpregnant women, and between pregnant women with and without current interpersonal abuse. Compared to nonpregnant women, pregnant women evidenced more social vulnerability but better behavioral health clinical profiles at treatment entry. Current interpersonal abuse was associated with increased mental health and trauma symptomatology but not with alcohol or drug abuse severity among pregnant women. The prenatal period is an important time for screening and intervention for factors such as social vulnerability and co-occurring disorders, known to affect pregnancy and infant outcomes; social and behavioral health services are particularly essential among pregnant women with co-occurring disorders.","School of Social Work, University of Southern California, 1150 South Olive Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90015, USA, leeking@usc.edu.",2014,10.1007/s10995-014-1508-x
73,,24766846,"A drug use survey among clients of harm reduction sites across British Columbia, Canada, 2012.","BACKGROUND: In British Columbia (BC), understanding of high-risk drug use trends is largely based on survey and cohort study data from two major cities, which may not be representative of persons who use drugs in other regions. Harm reduction stakeholders, representing each of the five geographic health regions in BC, identified a need for data on drug use to inform local and regional harm reduction activities across the province. The aims of this project were to (1) develop a drug use survey that could be feasibly administered at harm reduction (HR) sites across all health regions and (2) assess the data for differences in reported drug use frequencies by region.METHODS: A pilot survey focusing on current drug use was developed with stakeholders and administered among clients at 28 HR supply distribution sites across the province by existing staff and peers. Data were collated and analysed using univariate and bivariate descriptive statistics to assess differences in reported drug use frequencies by geography. A post-survey evaluation was conducted to assess acceptability and feasibility of the survey process for participating sites.RESULTS: Crack cocaine, heroin, and morphine were the most frequently reported drugs with notable regional differences. Polysubstance use was common among respondents (70%) with one region having 81% polysubstance use. Respondents surveyed in or near their region's major centre were more likely to report having used crack cocaine (p &lt; 0.0001) and heroin (p &lt; 0.0001) in the past week as compared to those residing &gt;50 km from the major centre. Participants accessing services &gt;50 km from the regional centre were more likely to have used morphine (p &lt; 0.0001). There was no difference in powder cocaine use by client/site proximity to the regional centre. Participating sites found the survey process acceptable, feasible to administer annually, and useful for responding to client needs.CONCLUSIONS: The survey was a feasible way for harm reduction sites across BC to obtain drug use data from clients who actively use drugs.

The objective of this study was to understand better how an array of individual characteristics, including factors that affect treatment, are related to treatment goals before beginning alcohol treatment in the COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study.METHOD: Participants were alcohol-dependent individuals (N = 1,156; 357 women) recruited at 11 outpatient academic alcoholism-treatment clinics across the United States to participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that combined behavioral intervention with acamprosate and/or naltrexone. Treatment goal was coded as controlled drinking, conditional abstinence, or total abstinence. Multinomial logistic regressions assessed whether there were significant relationships between predictor variables and pretreatment goal selection.RESULTS: Lower levels of alcohol-related consequences, lower readiness to change, higher family income, more daily drinkers in social network, and lack of prior treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous engagement predicted choice of a controlled drinking goal over a total abstinence goal. Fewer alcohol-related consequences, lower readiness to change, and more daily drinkers in-network predicted choice of a conditional abstinence goal over a total abstinence goal.CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of functioning, lower levels of consequences, no prior involvement in treatment and Alcoholics Anonymous, and a more drinking-saturated social environment are associated with the choice of a non-abstinence goal.","Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.",2014,NA

Sociodemographic and behavioral data were obtained from face-to-face interviews and psychiatric diagnoses from medical charts. Serology testing was conducted, and prevalence rate ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression.RESULTS: The weighted prevalence rates of current hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (HBsAg+) and previous HBV exposure (anti-HBc+) were 2.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5%-2.7%] and 17.1% (95% CI: 16.0%-19.0%), respectively. Correlates of HBsAg+ included male gender, younger age (18-29 years), unstable place of residence, intellectual disability, main psychiatric diagnosis of dementia, presence of other medical comorbitidy, use of alcohol/drugs during sex, more than one sexual partner and use of cocaine. Correlates of anti-HBc+ included male gender, older age (≥30 years), black skin color, lower education, unstable place of residence, currently hospitalized, intellectual disability, history of any sexually transmitted disease or syphilis, poor HIV knowledge, history of imprisonment and sexual violence.CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis B is an important comorbidity among psychiatric patients in Brazil. Screening for HBV, effective prevention and intervention strategies, including universal HBV immunization, should be routine practices in these mental health services.","Infectious Diseases Reference Center CTR-DIP Orestes Diniz, Municipal Health Division/Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil; Research Group in Epidemiology and Health Service Evaluation, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

During the period under study, 73 young people were infected with HIV (1.94%). In the female population, statistically significant associations were identified for HIV status and drug use and consumption of alcohol and other drugs, as well as being married or in a stable relationship. In males, the consumption of other drugs and homosexual/bisexual orientation were associated with HIV status. In both sexes, in the category in a stable relationship the HIV status was associated with a partner using drugs and/or infected with a STD and/or HIV.

Thirteen guidelines were included in the review, of which three were prepared in Asia, eight in Europe and two in the United States. Eleven guidelines made statements and recommendations on psychosocial issues. The guidelines were concordant in that mental health disorders and stress do not contribute to the aetiology of IBD, but that they can influence its course. It was recommended that IBD-patients should be screened for psychological distress. If indicated, psychotherapy and/or psychopharmacological therapy should be recommended. IBD-centres should collaborate with mental health care specialists. Tobacco smoking patients with Crohn's disease should be advised to quit.CONCLUSION: Patients and mental health specialists should be able to participate in future guideline groups to contribute to establishing recommendations on psychosocial issues in IBD. Future guidelines should acknowledge the presence of psychosocial problems in IBD-patients and encourage screening for psychological distress.","Winfried Häuser, Department of Internal Medicine I, Klinikum Saarbrücken, D-66119 Saarbrücken, Germany.",2014,10.3748/wjg.v20.i13.3663

Systematic review in support of the U.S. preventive services task force.,"RATIONALE: Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is now widely recommended for adults who are current or former heavy smokers. It is important to evaluate the impact of screening on smoking abstinence rates.OBJECTIVE: Among current and former smokers eligible for lung cancer screening, we sought to determine the consequence of screening with LDCT, as well as subsequent results, on smoking cessation and relapse rates.EVIDENCE REVIEW: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter, 2012), MEDLINE (2000 to May 31, 2013), reference lists of papers, and Scopus for relevant English-language studies and systematic reviews. To evaluate the effect of LDCT screening on smoking abstinence, we included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving asymptomatic adults. To evaluate the association of particular results and/or recommendations from a screening CT with smoking behaviors, we included results from RCTs as well as cohort studies.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 8,215 abstracts were reviewed. Three publications from two European RCTs and five publications from three cohort studies conducted in the United States met inclusion criteria. The process of LDCT lung cancer screening did not influence smoking behaviors. LDCT recipients with results concerning for lung cancer had higher abstinence rates than those with scans without such findings. This association may have a dose-response relationship in terms of the number of abnormal CT scans as well as the seriousness of the finding.CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence suggests LDCT lung cancer screening itself does not influence smoking behaviors, but positive results are associated with increased abstinence. As lung cancer screening is implemented in the general population, it is very important to evaluate its association with smoking behaviors to maximize its potential as a teachable moment to encourage long-term abstinence. Clinicians should consider tailoring LDCT result communication to emphasize the importance of smoking abstinence.",1 Health Services Research and Development.,2014,10.1513/AnnalsATS.201312-460OC
79,,24637237,"Preventing smoking initiation or relapse following 8.5 weeks of involuntary smoking abstinence in basic military training: trial design, interventions, and baseline data.","Smoking cessation is a primary method of reducing excess mortality and morbidity. Unfortunately, the vast majority of cessation attempts end in eventual relapse. Relapse-prevention interventions have shown some success at improving the long-term maintenance of tobacco abstinence among individuals motivated to abstain. However, involuntary tobacco abstinence (e.g., military training, hospitalization, incarceration) presents another opportunity for intervention to prevent relapse. During basic military training (BMT), tobacco use is strictly forbidden in all service branches, but tobacco relapse (and initiation) following BMT is extremely high. This paper reports on the design, intervention development, and baseline characteristics of a randomized controlled trial testing minimal interventions designed to prevent tobacco relapse among United States Air Force (USAF) personnel following BMT. Participants are randomized by squadron to receive either a standard smoking-cessation booklet, a new motivation-based booklet designed specifically for USAF personal, or the latter booklet combined with a brief, face-to-face motivational session. Primary outcomes will be self-reported tobacco use at 12 and 24month follow-up. Given that the Department of Defense is the world's largest employer, the potential of leveraging involuntary tobacco abstinence during BMT into extended abstinence has substantial public health significance.","Tobacco Research &amp; Intervention Program, H.

Participants were interviewed for sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Anal swab specimens were collected for anal cytology and HPV DNA testing using L1 polymerase chain reaction. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and/or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL).RESULTS: Anal swabs were collected from 343 participants. Prevalence of LSIL/HSIL was 24.8%. The majority (60.1%) reported sexual intercourse with both men and women in their lifetime. At least 36.7% had 1 or more oncogenic HPV types. Four variables were independently associated with the presence of LSIL/HSIL in multivariate analysis: history of sex with both men and women (odds ratio [OR] = 4.8) or men only (OR = 6.2) compared with those having sex with women only; current cigarette smoking (OR = 2.2); current CD4(+) level between 200 and 500 cells/mm(3) (OR = 2.9) or below 200 cells/mm(3) (OR = 3.8) compared with CD4(+) level above 500 cells/mm(3); and presence of oncogenic anal HPV infection (OR = 9.6).CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of AIN among HIV-positive men in Brazil. This population may serve as an important bridge population to women with implications for anogenital HPV infection in both men and women. Our findings confirm the need to assess screening programs for AIN among high-risk groups, similar to those used to prevent cervical cancer.","Departments of 1Obstetrics and Gynecology and 2Preventive and Social Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte; 3Federal University of São João del-Rei, Divinópolis; 4Department of Health Services, Belo Horizonte; 5Laboratório de Pesquisa Clinica em DST/AIDS, Instituto de Pesquisa Clinica Evandro Chagas, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro; 6Hospital Geral de Nova Iguaçu and AIDS and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, Fiocruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and 7University of California, San Francisco, CA.",2014,10.1097/LGT.0b013e31829ee855
81,,24529192,Systematic review and meta-analysis of the economic impact of smoking bans in restaurants and bars.,"AIMS: To review systematically the literature on the economic impact of smoking bans in bars and restaurants and provide an estimate of the impact size using meta-analysis.METHODS: Studies were identified by systematic database searches and screening references of reviews and relevant studies. Google and web-pages of tobacco control agencies were also searched. The review identified 56 studies using absolute sales, sales ratio or employment data and employing regression methods to evaluate the impact of smoking bans in the United States, Australia or in countries in South America or Europe. The meta-analysis included 39 comparable studies, with 129 cases identified based on the outcome measure, scope of the ban, type of establishment and geographical location. Methodological quality was assessed based on four pre-determined criteria. Study and case selection and data extraction were conducted independently by two researchers.RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analysis of all cases showed no associations between smoking bans and changes in absolute sales or employment. An increase in the share of bar and restaurant sector sales in total retail sales was associated with smoking bans [0.23 percentage-points; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.375]. When cases were separated by business type (bars or restaurants or wider hospitality including bars and restaurants), some differential impacts emerged.CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the economic impact of smoking bans in hospitality sector showed overall no substantial economic gains or losses. Differential impacts were observed across individual business types and outcome variable, but at aggregate level these appear to balance out.","London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK; Centre of Health Policy and Management, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland.",2014,10.1111/add.12486

This study aims to review the current literature on the participation and roles of APRN/PAs in providing cancer screening and prevention recommendations in primary care settings in the United States.METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and CINAHL to identify studies published in 1990-2011 reporting on cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening and smoking cessation, diet, and physical activity recommendations by APRN/PAs in the United States. A total of 15 studies met all of our eligibility criteria. Key study, provider, and patient characteristics were abstracted as were findings about APRN/PA recommendations for screening and prevention.RESULTS: Most studies were cross-sectional, showed results from within a single city or state, had relatively small sample sizes, reported non-standardized outcome measures. Few studies reported any patient characteristics. APRN/PAs are involved in recommending cancer screening and prevention, although we found variation across screening tests and health behavior recommendations.CONCLUSIONS: Additional research on the cancer prevention and screening practices of APRN/PAs in primary care settings using standardized outcome measures in relation to evidence-based guidelines may help strengthen primary care delivery in the United States.","Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. deanna.Kepka@hci.utah.edu.",2014,10.1186/1472-6963-14-68
83,,24520906,Computerized versus in-person brief intervention for drug misuse: a randomized clinical trial.,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have found that brief interventions (BIs) for drug misuse have superior effectiveness to no-treatment controls. However, many health centers do not provide BIs for drug use consistently due to insufficient behavioral health staff capacity. Computerized BIs for drug use are a promising approach, but their effectiveness compared with in-person BIs has not been established. This study compared the effectiveness of a computerized brief intervention (CBI) to an in-person brief intervention (IBI) delivered by a behavioral health counselor.METHODS: Two-arm randomized clinical trial, conducted in two health centers in New Mexico, United States. Participants were 360 adult primary care patients with moderate-risk drug scores on the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) who were randomly assigned on a 1 : 1 basis to a computerized brief intervention (CBI) or to an in-person brief intervention (IBI) delivered by a behavioral health counselor. Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and included the ASSIST and drug testing on hair samples.RESULTS: The IBI and CBI conditions did not differ at 3 months on global ASSIST drug scores [b = -1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -4.37, 0.80] or drug-positive hair tests [odds ratio (OR) = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.47, 2.02]. There was a statistically significant advantage of CBI over IBI in substance-specific ASSIST scores for marijuana (b = -1.73; 95% CI = -2.91, -0.55; Cohen's d = 0.26; P = 0.004) and cocaine (b = -4.48; 95% CI = -8.26, -0.71; Cohen's d = 0.50; P = 0.021) at 3 months.CONCLUSIONS: Computerized brief intervention can be an effective alternative to in-person brief intervention for addressing moderate drug use in primary care.","Friends Research Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA.",2014,10.1111/add.12502

We conducted a two-arm study with social networks randomized to the intervention or a standard services control arm. We evaluated intervention uptake, adherence, and safety; and assessed evidence of effects on behavioral outcomes associated with unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection risk.RESULTS: A total of 72 social networks composed of 162 youth enrolled, with 92% retention over 6 months. Seventy-two percent of youth randomized to the intervention participated in intervention activities: 53% received at least one conditional cash transfer payment and 66% came to at least one life skills session. We found no evidence that cash payments financed illicit or high-risk behavior. At 6 months, compared with controls, intervention participants had a lower odds of hanging out on the street frequently (odds ratio [OR], .54; p = .10) and a lower odds of reporting that their close friends had been incarcerated (OR, .6; p = .12). They reported less regular alcohol use (OR, .54; p = .04) and a lower odds of having sex (OR, .50; p = .04).CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility evaluation of Yo Puedo demonstrated its promise; a larger evaluation of effects on pregnancy and sustained behavioral changes is warranted.","Women's Global Health Imperative, RTI International, San Francisco, California; School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California.

Telephone interventions may be an efficient method to provide mandated students with an intervention, especially when they are away from campus during summer vacation. However, little is known about the utility of telephone-delivered brief motivational interventions.METHOD: Participants in the study (N=57) were college students mandated to attend an alcohol program following a campus-based alcohol citation. Participants were randomized to a brief motivational phone intervention (pBMI) (n=36) or assessment only (n=21). Ten participants (27.8%) randomized to the pBMI did not complete the intervention. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3, 6, and 9 months post-intervention.RESULTS: Results indicated the pBMI significantly reduced the number of alcohol-related problems compared to the assessment-only group. Participants who did not complete the pBMI appeared to be lighter drinkers at baseline and randomization, suggesting the presence of alternate influences on alcohol-related problems.CONCLUSION: Phone BMIs may be an efficient and cost-effective method to reduce harms associated with alcohol use by heavy-drinking mandated students during the summer months.","Mental Health and Behavioral Sciences Service, Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, 830 Chalkstone Avenue, Providence, RI 02908; Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies, Box G-S121-5, Providence, RI 02912.

Nevertheless, little has been reported about long-term cancer trends in Greenland. Our aim was to describe and interpret the incidence of cervical cancer from 1950 to 2009.MATERIAL AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed for articles reporting the incidence of cervical cancer in Greenland. We supplemented this with data for 1980-2009 obtained from the Chief Medical Officer of Greenland.RESULTS: Incidence of cervical cancer was around 10 per 100 000 women (age-standardised, world population, ASW) in the 1950s, 30 per 100 000 in the 1960s, and in the 1980s around 60 per 100 000. From 1985 onwards, the incidence of cervical cancer started decreasing to the current level of 25 per 100 000.CONCLUSION: The steep increase in the incidence of cervical cancer from the 1950s onwards is unlikely to be explained by increasing completeness of data. In parallel with the economic development, however, out-of-wedlock births (proxy for sexual behaviour) increased dramatically from 1935 onwards while tobacco use increased from the 1950s onwards. From the late 1960s to around 1990, data suggested rather stable but high levels of sexual habits. The decrease in the incidence of cervical cancer since 1985 is consistent with the introduction of screening. The data strongly suggested that the increased burden of cervical cancer in Greenlandic women was real and followed earlier changes in sexual behaviour; these changes were likely a consequence of the tremendous societal changes.","Department of Public Health, University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen K , Denmark.",2014,10.3109/0284186X.2014.883462

More smokers who were sent the free nicotine patches (n = 1695; 54.8%) reported using NRT than those who did not receive them (12 weeks: 84.3% vs 41.9%, P &lt; .001; 26 weeks: 87.6% vs 51.1%, P &lt; .001). The use of NRT was associated with greater smoking abstinence at 12 weeks (P &lt; .001) and 26 weeks (P &lt; .05), especially if used for more than 2 weeks (P &lt; .001). Smokers assigned to a self-help booklet or cessation Web site and heavier smokers were most likely to use NRT (P &lt; .05), whereas those reporting marijuana use and binge drinking used NRT less (P &lt; .05).CONCLUSIONS: Many young adults were willing to try NRT, and it appeared to help them quit in the context of community-based cessation services. Strategies should be developed to make NRT available to this age group and support them in using it to prevent lifelong smoking.","Klein Buendel, Inc, Golden, Colorado (Drs Buller and Bettinghaus); Department of Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle (Dr Halperin); Oregon Research Institute, Eugene (Dr Severson); Cancer Council Victoria, Carlton South, Victoria, Australia (Dr Borland); School of Communication, Ohio State University, Columbus (Dr Slater); National Jewish Health, Denver, Colorado (Dr Tinkelman); School of Public Health, University of Alabama at Birmingham (Dr Cutter); and Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addictions, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque (Dr Woodall).",2014,10.1097/PHH.0b013e3182a0b8c7

The aim of this investigation was to determine if a multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation enhancements.DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n = 10, patient n = 409) providers received 1-day workshop training on evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four 30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n = 10, patient n = 469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements.SETTING: Trauma centers in the United States of America.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 878 blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI).MEASUREMENTS: MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6- and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT).FINDINGS: Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of the year after injury (relative risk = 0.88, 95%, confidence interval = 0.79, 0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P = 0.002).CONCLUSION: Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among patients without TBI.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.",2014,10.1111/add.12492

Knowing the factors that contribute to sexual concerns provides insights that help to promote inclusion of assessment of relevant sexual activity and provide sexual counseling as a standard of care.AIM: This study examined demographic factors, comorbid conditions, and sexual activities as predictive of sexual concerns. Specific sexual activities and demographic variables were also examined for their relation to sexual concerns.METHODS: This study was a sub-analysis of a cross-sectional observational study testing a regression model of factors that predicted sexual concerns in a broad sample of cardiac patients in the United States, using a self-report survey method.RESULTS: More comorbidities and types of sexual activities contributed to greater sexual concerns reported by respondents. Sexual activities resulting in overall sexual concerns included hugging/kissing, oral sex, and finger penetration. Non-Whites reported more sexual concerns, sexual fears, and symptoms related to sexual activity. Those who were not working/retired from employment reported significantly more sexual concerns and dysfunction, whereas, those who had a smoking/tobacco use history reported more sexual concerns, symptoms, and dysfunction.CONCLUSION: This study underscores that cardiac patients across a variety of diagnoses and comorbidities often experience sexual concerns, fears, symptoms, and dysfunction. The strongest predictors of sexual concerns were the number of cardiac and noncardiac comorbidities, thus illustrating the importance of a thorough assessment of these factors when examining sexual concerns of cardiac patients.","School of Nursing, Wichita State University, USA victoria.mosack@wichita.edu.",2013,10.1177/1474515113517782

92,,24345001,Cost of speech-language interventions for children and youth with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder in Canada.,"This study, which is part of a large economic project on the overall burden and cost associated with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in Canada, estimated the cost of 1:1 speech-language interventions among children and youth with FASD for Canada in 2011. The number of children and youth with FASD and speech-language disorder(s) (SLD), the distribution of the level of severity, and the number of hours needed to treat were estimated using data from the available literature. 1:1 speech-language interventions were computed using the average cost per hour for speech-language pathologists. It was estimated that ˜ 37,928 children and youth with FASD had SLD in Canada in 2011. Using the most conservative approach, the annual cost of 1:1 speech-language interventions among children and youth with FASD is substantial, ranging from $72.5 million to $144.1 million Canadian dollars. Speech-language pathologists should be aware of the disproportionate number of children and youth with FASD who have SLD and the need for early identification to improve access to early intervention. Early identification and access to high quality services may have a role in decreasing the risk of developing the secondary disabilities and in reducing the economic burden of FASD on society.","Social and Epidemiological Research Department , Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON , Canada.",2013,10.3109/17549507.2013.862858
93,,24316677,LINE1 methylation levels associated with increased bladder cancer risk in pre-diagnostic blood DNA among US (PLCO) and European (ATBC) cohort study participants.,"Global methylation in blood DNA has been associated with bladder cancer risk in case-control studies, but has not been examined prospectively. We examined the association between LINE1 total percent 5-methylcytosine and bladder cancer risk using pre-diagnostic blood DNA from the United States-based, Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (299 cases/676 controls), and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) cohort of Finnish male smokers (391 cases/778 controls). Logistic regression adjusted for age at blood draw, study center, pack-years of smoking, and sex was used to estimate odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using study- and sex-specific methylation quartiles. In PLCO, higher, although non-significant, bladder cancer risks were observed for participants in the highest three quartiles (Q2-Q4) compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.96 -1.92). The association was stronger in males (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.00-2.20) and statistically significant among male smokers (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.14-2.95). No association was found among females or female smokers. Findings for male smokers were validated in ATBC (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.62-3.30) and a highly significant trend was observed (P = 8.7 × 10(-7)). After determining that study data could be combined, pooled analysis of PLCO and ATBC male smokers (580 cases/1119 controls), ORs were significantly higher in Q2-Q4 compared with Q1 (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.52-2.72), and a trend across quartiles was observed (P = 0.0001). These findings suggest that higher global methylation levels prior to diagnosis may increase bladder cancer risk, particularly among male smokers.","Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG); U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI); National Institutes of Health (NIH); Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS); Bethesda, MD USA.",2013,10.4161/epi.27386
94,,24309587,Factors influencing the decline in stroke mortality: a statement from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke mortality has been declining since the early 20th century. The reasons for this are not completely understood, although the decline is welcome. As a result of recent striking and more accelerated decreases in stroke mortality, stroke has fallen from the third to the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. This has prompted a detailed assessment of the factors associated with the change in stroke risk and mortality. This statement considers the evidence for factors that have contributed to the decline and how they can be used in the design of future interventions for this major public health burden.METHODS: Writing group members were nominated by the committee chair and co-chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific Statements Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references to published clinical and epidemiological studies, morbidity and mortality reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize evidence and to indicate gaps in current knowledge. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on this document and approved the final version. The document underwent extensive American Heart Association internal peer review, Stroke Council leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before consideration and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.RESULTS: The decline in stroke mortality over the past decades represents a major improvement in population health and is observed for both sexes and for all racial/ethnic and age groups. In addition to the overall impact on fewer lives lost to stroke, the major decline in stroke mortality seen among people &lt;65 years of age represents a reduction in years of potential life lost. The decline in mortality results from reduced incidence of stroke and lower case-fatality rates. These significant improvements in stroke outcomes are concurrent with cardiovascular risk factor control interventions. Although it is difficult to calculate specific attributable risk estimates, efforts in hypertension control initiated in the 1970s appear to have had the most substantial influence on the accelerated decline in stroke mortality. Although implemented later, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia control and smoking cessation programs, particularly in combination with treatment of hypertension, also appear to have contributed to the decline in stroke mortality. The potential effects of telemedicine and stroke systems of care appear to be strong but have not been in place long enough to indicate their influence on the decline. Other factors had probable effects, but additional studies are needed to determine their contributions.CONCLUSIONS: The decline in stroke mortality is real and represents a major public health and clinical medicine success story. The repositioning of stroke from third to fourth leading cause of death is the result of true mortality decline and not an increase in mortality from chronic lung disease, which is now the third leading cause of death in the United States. There is strong evidence that the decline can be attributed to a combination of interventions and programs based on scientific findings and implemented with the purpose of reducing stroke risks, the most likely being improved control of hypertension. Thus, research studies and the application of their findings in developing intervention programs have improved the health of the population. The continued application of aggressive evidence-based public health programs and clinical interventions is expected to result in further declines in stroke mortality.",NA,2013,10.1161/01.str.0000437068.30550.cf
95,,24287124,Impact of a web-based intervention supplemented with text messages to improve cancer prevention behaviors among adolescents: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a web-based intervention supplemented with text messages to reduce cancer risk linked with smoking, unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and sun exposure.METHODS: A total of 2001 voluntary adolescents from Spain and Mexico were recruited between 2009 and 2012 and randomly assigned to: one control group and two experimental groups, which received exclusively the online intervention (experimental group 1) or the intervention supplemented with encouraging text messages (experimental group 2). The educational intervention was based on both: successful psychosocial models (i.e. A.S.E. and Transtheoretical model) and the school curriculum.RESULTS: After a 9-month follow-up, the prevalence of students who did not eat fruit was reduced significantly in all groups: experimental group 1 (-62.6%), experimental group 2 (-71.5%) and even the control group (-66.8%). Being overweight was only reduced in the experimental group 2 (-19.6%). The total cancer behavioral risk score, which ranged from 0 to 100 points (highest risk), was significantly reduced in the experimental group 1 (-3.5 points) and in the experimental group 2 (-5.3 points). The text-supplemented online intervention increased the probability of improving the post-test total cancer behavioral risk (OR=1.62).CONCLUSION: The web-based intervention supplemented with text messages had a positive global impact, but it lead to only minimal changes in risky behaviors. This intervention appears useful in controlling overweight adolescents.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN27988779.","Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Oviedo, Spain; University Institute of Oncology of Asturias, Spain.

Abstracts were searched for the terms ivermectin AND (head lice or pediculus or pediculosis), topical ivermectin, ivermectin lotion, ivermectin AND (pharmacology OR pharmacokinetics). The New Drug Application filed with the Food and Drug Administration and the product data sheets for ivermectin were obtained.STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles retrieved from the search were evaluated for relevance to the objective.DATA SYNTHESIS: The recommended first-line head lice treatments in the United States are permethrin 1% or pyrethrins, with malathion 0.5% lotion used as a second-line treatment. Significantly more of the 289 head lice-infested participants using topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion were lice-free at day 15 when compared with vehicle control (73.8% vs 17.6%; P &lt; .001) in 2 studies. Although this rate is lower than other third-line treatments (eg, spinosad 0.9% or benzyl alcohol 5%), topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion is well tolerated (pruritus, the most common adverse event, 0.9%) and requires only a single application.CONCLUSIONS: Topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion kills head lice by increasing chloride in muscle cells, causing hyperpolarization and paralysis. Only 1 application is required; when the treated eggs hatch, the lice are not viable because they cannot feed as a result of pharyngeal muscle paralysis. Minimal systemic absorption occurs following topical application. Studies have demonstrated that topical ivermectin 0.5% is a safe and efficacious treatment for head lice. Although it has no documented resistance, there is limited clinical experience, it requires a prescription, and it is expensive. Therefore it should be reserved as a third-line treatment for head lice in the United States.","University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia.",2013,10.1177/1060028013500645
97,,24174612,Tobacco cessation among low-income smokers: motivational enhancement and nicotine patch treatment.,"INTRODUCTION: Despite decades of tobacco use decline among the general population in the United States, tobacco use among low-income populations continues to be a major public health concern. Smoking rates are higher among individuals with less than a high school education, those with no health insurance, and among individuals living below the federal poverty level. Despite these disparities, smoking cessation treatments for low-income populations have not been extensively tested. In the current study, the efficacy of 2 adjunctive smoking cessation interventions was evaluated among low-income smokers who were seen in a primary care setting.METHODS: A total of 846 participants were randomly assigned either to motivational enhancement treatment plus brief physician advice and 8 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or to standard care, which consisted of brief physician advice and 8 weeks of NRT. Tobacco smoking abstinence was at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months following baseline.RESULTS: The use of the nicotine patch, telephone counseling, and positive decisional balance were predictive of increased abstinence rates, and elevated stress levels and temptation to smoke in both social/habit and negative affect situations decreased abstinence rates across time. Analyses showed intervention effects on smoking temptations, length of patch use, and number of telephone contacts. Direct intervention effects on abstinence rates were not significant, after adjusting for model predictors and selection bias due to perirandomization attrition.CONCLUSIONS: Integrating therapeutic approaches that promote use of and adherence to medications for quitting smoking and that target stress management and reducing negative affect may enhance smoking cessation among low-income smokers.","Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI;",2013,10.1093/ntr/ntt166

99,,24044981,Allopregnanolone as regenerative therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease: translational development and clinical promise.,"Herein, we review a translational development plan to advance allopregnanolone to the clinic as a regenerative therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Alzheimer's. Allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid that declines with age and neurodegenerative disease, was exogenously administered and assessed for safety and efficacy to promote neuro-regeneration, cognitive function and reduction of Alzheimer's pathology. Allopregnanolone-induced neurogenesis correlated with restoration of learning and memory function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and was comparably efficacious in aged normal mice. Critical to success was a dosing and treatment regimen that was consistent with the temporal requirements of systems biology of regeneration in brain. A treatment regimen that adhered to regenerative requirements of brain was also efficacious in reducing Alzheimer's pathology. With an optimized dosing and treatment regimen, chronic allopregnanolone administration promoted neurogenesis, oligodendrogenesis, reduced neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid burden while increasing markers of white matter generation and cholesterol homeostasis. Allopregnanolone meets three of the four drug-like physicochemical properties described by Lipinski's rule that predict the success rate of drugs in development for clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes, securing GMP material, development of clinically translatable formulations and acquiring regulatory approval are discussed. Investigation of allopregnanolone as a regenerative therapeutic has provided key insights into mechanistic targets for neurogenesis and disease modification, dosing requirements, optimal treatment regimen, route of administration and the appropriate formulation necessary to advance to proof of concept clinical studies to determine efficacy of allopregnanolone as a regenerative and disease modifying therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease.","Department of Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90089, USA.",2013,10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.08.004
100,,24012648,The effect of snus on alcohol-related cigarette administration in dependent and non-dependent smokers.,"INTRODUCTION: Alcohol has been found to increase tobacco smoking in both dependent daily smokers (DDS) and nondependent nondaily smokers (NNS), yet little attention has been directed toward examining how different treatments/products modify drinking-related smoking behavior.METHODS: This study examined the acute effects of snus (4mg of nicotine) on alcohol-related smoking responses in 18 DDS and 17 NNS. During each double-blind session, participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following combinations: alcohol and snus, alcohol and placebo snus, placebo alcohol and snus, or placebo alcohol and placebo snus. Participants consumed their assigned beverage before absorbing their session's product, and after 30min participants could self-administer puffs of their preferred brand of cigarette over a 60-minute period using a progressive ratio task.RESULTS: Alcohol significantly increased tobacco craving (p&lt;.001) and tended to decrease latency to start smoking (p=.021) but only among NNS. In contrast, snus tended to decrease the number of puffs earned and how hard DDS worked for puffs in both beverage conditions (ps≤.019) but it did not alter the smoking behavior of NNS. Craving was not significantly impacted by snus in either type of smoker.DISCUSSION: These findings raise the possibility that different processes mediate alcohol and cigarette co-use in NNS and DDS and suggest that snus may be effective in reducing alcohol-related cigarette use in DDS specifically.","Dalhousie University, Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Life Science Centre, 1355 Oxford street, PO Box 15000, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3H 4R2, Canada.

101,,23993339,"[Multidimensional family therapy: which influences, which specificities?].","BACKGROUND: Among illegal psycho-active drugs, cannabis is the most consumed by French adolescents. Multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) is a family-based outpatient therapy which has been developed for adolescents with drug and behavioral problems. MDFT has shown its effectiveness in adolescents with substance abuse disorders (notably cannabis abuse) not only in the United States but also in Europe (International Cannabis Need of Treatment project). MDFT is a multidisciplinary approach and an evidence-based treatment, at the crossroads of developmental psychology, ecological theories and family therapy. Its psychotherapeutic techniques find its roots in a variety of approaches which include systemic family therapy and cognitive therapy.OBJECTIVE: The aims of this paper are: to describe all the backgrounds of MDFT by highlighting its characteristics; to explain how structural and strategy therapies have influenced this approach; to explore the links between MDFT, brief strategic family therapy and multi systemic family therapy; and to underline the specificities of this family therapy method.DISCUSSION: The multidimensional family therapy was created on the bases of 1) the integration of multiple therapeutic techniques stemming from various family therapy theories; and 2) studies which have shown family therapy efficiency. Several trials have shown a better efficiency of MDFT compared to group treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy and home-based treatment. Studies have also highlighted that MDFT led to superior treatment outcomes, especially among young people with severe drug use and psychiatric co-morbidities. In the field of systemic family therapies, MDFT was influenced by: 1) the structural family therapy (S. Minuchin), 2) the strategic family theory (J. Haley), and 3) the intergenerational family therapy (Bowen and Boszormenyi-Nagy). MDFT has specific aspects: MDFT therapists think in a multidimensional perspective (because an adolescent's drug abuse is a multidimensional disorder), they work with the system and the subsystem, focusing on the emotional expression and the parental and adolescent enactment (a principle of change and intervention). MDFT includes four modules (adolescent, parent, family interaction, and extra-familial systems) in three steps (1) build the foundation, (2) prompt action and change by working the themes, and (3) seal the changes and exit). The supervision philosophy and methodology is also based on the principle of multidimensionality. Indeed, many different supervision methods are used in a coordinated way to produce the required adherence and clinical skill (written case conceptualizations, videotape presentation and live supervision).CONCLUSION: Family vulnerability and chronicity factors are a major challenge of modern research. MDFT questions the reciprocal adjustments that have to be made by the subject and his/her familial environment. It also helps to clarify the therapeutic interventions in order to enhance better adolescent development. For this purpose, MDFT offers a specific therapeutic frame, for it is a family therapy focused on adolescents with cannabis abuse problems. Its action and questioning on parental practices and adolescents lead to better psycho-educational support. It focuses the therapeutic process on emotions and family capacity for change.","Centre Pierre-Nicole, 27, rue Pierre-Nicole, 75005 Paris, France; Laboratoire de psychopathologie et processus de santé, université Paris Descartes, Sorbonne Paris Cité, 71, avenue Édouard-Vaillant, 92774 Boulogne-Billancourt, France.

The implementation of an effective smoking cessation intervention would have a significant impact on the health of mothers and infants. The &quot;5 A's&quot; (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) is a strategy consisting of a brief cessation counseling session of 5-15 minutes delivered by a trained provider. The &quot;5 A's&quot; is considered the standard of care worldwide; however, it is under used in Argentina and Uruguay.METHODS: We will conduct a two-arm, parallel cluster randomized controlled trial of an implementation intervention in 20 prenatal care settings in Argentina and Uruguay. Prenatal care settings will be randomly allocated to either an intervention or a control group after a baseline data collection period. Midwives' facilitators in the 10 intervention prenatal clinics (clusters) will be identified and trained to deliver the &quot;5 A's&quot; to pregnant women and will then disseminate and implement the program. The 10 clusters in the control group will continue with their standard in-service activities. The intervention will be tailored by formative research to be readily applicable to local prenatal care services at maternity hospitals and acceptable to local pregnant women and health providers. Our primary hypothesis is that the intervention is feasible in prenatal clinics in Argentina and Uruguay and will increase the frequency of women receiving tobacco use cessation counseling during pregnancy in the intervention clinics compared to the control clinics. Our secondary hypotheses are that the intervention will decrease the frequency of women who smoke by the end of pregnancy, and that the intervention will increase the attitudes and readiness of midwives towards providing counseling to women in the intervention clinics compared to the control clinics.",NA,2013,10.1186/1742-4755-10-44
103,,23921458,In-work tax credits for families and their impact on health status in adults.,"BACKGROUND: By improving two social determinants of health (poverty and unemployment) in low- and middle-income families on or at risk of welfare, in-work tax credit for families (IWTC) interventions could impact health status and outcomes in adults.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of IWTCs on health outcomes in working-age adults (18 to 64 years).SEARCH METHODS: We searched 16 electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as six grey literature databases between July and September 2012 for records published between January 1980 and July 2012. We also searched key organisational websites, handsearched reference lists of included records and relevant journals, and contacted academic experts.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials and cohort, controlled before-and-after (CBA) and interrupted time series (ITS) studies of IWTCs in working-age adults. Included primary outcomes were: self rated general health; mental health/psychological distress; mental illness; overweight/obesity; alcohol use and tobacco use.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.MAIN RESULTS: Five studies (one CBA and four ITS) comprising a total of 5,677,383 participants (all women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were synthesised narratively. The in-work tax credit intervention assessed in all included studies is the permanent Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States, established in 1975. This intervention distributed nearly USD 62 billion to over 27 million individuals in 2011, and its administration costs were less than one per cent of its total costs. All included studies carried a high risk of bias (especially from confounding and insufficient control for underlying time trends). Due to the small number of (observational) studies and their high risk of bias, we judged this body of evidence to have very low overall quality.One study found that IWTC had no detectable effect on self rated general health and mental health/psychological distress five years after its implementation (i.e. a considerable change in the generosity of the permanent IWTC) and on overweight/obesity eight years after implementation. One study found no effect of IWTC on tobacco use five years after implementation, one a moderate reduction in tobacco use one year after implementation (odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.96), and one differential effects, with no effect in African-Americans and a large reduction in European-Americans two years after implementation (risk difference -11.1%, 95% CI -20.9% to -1.3%). No evidence was available for the effect of IWTC on mental illness and alcohol use. No adverse effects of IWTC were identified.One study also found no detectable effect of IWTC on the number of bad physical health days and of risky biomarkers for inflammation, cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions eight years after implementation. One study found that IWTC had a large, positive effect on income from wages or salaries one year after implementation. Two studies found no effect on employment two and five years after implementation, whereas two found a moderate increase five and eight years after implementation and one a large increase in employment due to IWTC one year after implementation.No differences in outcomes between groups with different educational status were found for self rated health and mental health/psychological distress. In one study European-American women with lower levels of education were more likely to reduce tobacco use, while tobacco use did not change among African-American women with lower levels of education. However, no differences in tobacco use by educational status were observed in a second study. Two studies found that the intervention may have reduced inequity with respect to employment, where women with less education were more likely to move into employment (although one did not establish whether this difference was statistically significant), while two studies found no such difference and no studies found differences by ethnic group on employment rates.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the small and methodologically limited existing body of evidence with a high risk of bias provides no evidence for an effect of in-work tax credit for families interventions on health status (except for mixed evidence for tobacco smoking) in adults.","Department of Public Health, University of Otago, 23A Mein Street, Newtown, Wellington, New Zealand, 6242.",2013,10.1002/14651858.CD009963.pub2

The sample involved 406 adolescents. Sociodemographic, knowledge-related and practice-based variables were explored.RESULTS: The adolescents had high and very high levels of knowledge; 90.5 % of the adolescents had received information about sex and pregnancy; the main source of information came from their parents (67.5 %). Safe sex for 26.7 % of the adolescents meant just using a condom. Regarding their sexuality (practice), 42 % stated that they had had sexual relationships, beginning on average when around 13-years-old. Condom use was the most used protection mechanism. 12.5 % stated that they had used psychoactive substances or alcohol to intensify sexual experience; 87.7 % stated that they would seek counselling or treatment in a hospital or health centre without telling their parents if they contracted a sexually- transmitted infection (STI).CONCLUSIONS: The adolescents involved in this study had high levels of knowledge; however, such knowledge is not enough to stop them beginning their sexual life early and/or increasing the probability of using a condom or contraceptive when beginning their sexual relationships.","Investigadores independientes, Cali, Colombia. hrengifo@gmail.com",2013,S0124-00642012000400002
105,,23899425,Organizational attributes and screening and brief intervention in primary care.,"Overconsumption of alcohol is well known to lead to numerous health and social problems. Prevalence studies of United States adults found that 20% of patients meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder. Routine screening for alcohol use is recommended in primary care settings, yet little is known about the organizational factors that are related to successful implementation of screening and brief intervention (SBI) and treatment in these settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate organizational attributes in primary care practices that were included in a practice-based research network trial to implement alcohol SBI. The Survey of Organizational Attributes in Primary Care (SOAPC) has reliably measured four factors: communication, decision-making, stress/chaos and history of change. This 21-item instrument was administered to 178 practice members at the baseline of this trial, to evaluate for relationship of organizational attributes to the implementation of alcohol SBI and treatment. No significant relationships were found correlating alcohol screening, identification of high-risk drinkers and brief intervention, to the factors measured in the SOAPC instrument. These results highlight the challenges related to the use of organizational survey instruments in explaining or predicting variations in clinical improvement. Comprehensive mixed methods approaches may be more effective in evaluations of the implementation of SBI and treatment.","College of Nursing, Department of Nursing, Medical University of South Carolina, 99 Jonathan Lucas St MSC 160, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. nemethl@musc.edu",2013,10.1016/j.addbeh.2013.05.016

Because early-stage lung cancer is associated with lower mortality than late-stage disease, early detection and treatment may be beneficial.PURPOSE: To update the 2004 review of screening for lung cancer for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, focusing on screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (2000 to 31 May 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter of 2012), Scopus, and reference lists.STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials or cohort studies that evaluated LDCT screening for lung cancer.DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted study data about participants, design, analysis, follow-up, and results, and a second reviewer checked extractions. Two reviewers rated study quality using established criteria.DATA SYNTHESIS: Four trials reported results of LDCT screening among patients with smoking exposure. One large good-quality trial reported that screening was associated with significant reductions in lung cancer (20%) and all-cause (6.7%) mortality. Three small European trials showed no benefit of screening. Harms included radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, and a high rate of false-positive findings that typically were resolved with further imaging. Smoking cessation was not affected. Incidental findings were common.LIMITATIONS: Three trials were underpowered and of insufficient duration to evaluate screening effectiveness. Overdiagnosis, an important harm of screening, is of uncertain magnitude. No studies reported results in women or minority populations.CONCLUSION: Strong evidence shows that LDCT screening can reduce lung cancer and all-cause mortality. The harms associated with screening must be balanced with the benefits.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",NA,2013,10.7326/0003-4819-159-6-201309170-00690

In this study, we sought to determine whether a pragmatic perioperative smoking cessation intervention designed for a busy preadmission clinic would be successful in reducing smoking rates and intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications.METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in London, Ontario, Canada. Patients seen in the preadmission clinic at least 3 weeks preoperatively were randomized to either the control group (84 patients) or the intervention group (84 patients). The control group received no specific smoking cessation intervention. The intervention group received (1) brief counseling by the preadmission nurse, (2) brochures on smoking cessation, (3) referral to the Canadian Cancer Society's Smokers' Helpline, and (4) a free 6-week supply of transdermal nicotine replacement therapy. All outcome assessors and caregivers on the operative day were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was the rate of smoking cessation as confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide breath test. Secondary outcomes included perioperative complications and smoking status at 30 days postoperatively.RESULTS: Between October 2010 and April 2012, 168 patients were recruited into the study. Smoking cessation occurred in 12 patients (14.3%) in the intervention group as compared with 3 patients (3.6%) in the control group (relative risk 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-13.7; P = 0.03). The overall rate of combined intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications was not significantly different between intervention and control groups (13.1% and 16.7%, respectively; relative risk 0.79; 95% CI, 0.38-1.63; P = 0.67). At follow-up 30 days postoperatively, smoking cessation was reported in 22 patients (28.6%) in the intervention group compared with 8 patients (11%) in controls (relative risk 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5; P = 0.008).CONCLUSIONS: One of the objections to widespread use of smoking cessation interventions in the preadmission clinic is that it is too labor-intensive. The results of this study show that a smoking cessation intervention, designed to minimize additional use of physician or nursing time, results in decreased smoking rates on the day of surgery and promotes abstinence 30 days postoperatively.","FRCPC, Department of Anesthesia and Perioperative Medicine, University of Western Ontario, Smoking Cessation Study Linda Szabo University Hospital-B3-218, 339 Windermere Rd., London, Ontario, Canada N6A 5A5. suze.lee@utoronto.c.",2013,10.1213/ANE.0b013e318298a6b0
108,,23846588,"Overcoming Addictions, a Web-based application, and SMART Recovery, an online and in-person mutual help group for problem drinkers, part 1: three-month outcomes of a randomized controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Overcoming Addictions (OA) is an abstinence-oriented, cognitive behavioral, Web application based on the program of SMART Recovery. SMART Recovery is an organization that has adapted empirically supported treatment strategies for use in a mutual help framework with in-person meetings, online meetings, a forum, and other resources.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of OA and SMART Recovery (SR) with problem drinkers who were new to SMART Recovery. Our experimental hypotheses were: (1) all groups will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug-related consequences at follow-up compared to their baseline levels, (2) the OA condition will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug-related consequences more than the control group (SR), and (3) the OA+SR condition will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug-related consequences more than the control group (SR only).METHODS: We recruited 189 heavy problem drinkers primarily through SMART Recovery's website and in-person meetings throughout the United States. We randomly assigned participants to (1) OA alone, (2) OA+attend SMART Recovery (SR) meetings (OA+SR), or (3) attend SR only. Baseline and follow-ups were conducted via GoToMeeting sessions with a Research Assistant (RA) and the study participant. We interviewed significant others to corroborate the participant's self-report. Primary outcome measures included percent days abstinent (PDA), mean drinks per drinking day (DDD), and alcohol/drug-related consequences.RESULTS: The intent-to-treat analysis of the 3-month outcomes supported the first hypothesis but not the others. Participants in all groups significantly increased their percent days abstinent from 44% to 72% (P&lt;.001), decreased their mean drinks per drinking day from 8.0 to 4.6 (P&lt;.001), and decreased their alcohol/drug-related problems (P&lt;.001). Actual use relationships were found for the OA groups, between SR online meetings and improvement in PDA (r=.261, P=.033). In addition in the OA groups, the number of total sessions of support (including SR &amp; other meetings, counselor visits) was significantly related to PDA (r=.306, P=012) and amount of improvement in alcohol-related problems (r=.305, P=.012). In the SR only group, the number of face-to-face meetings was significantly related to all three dependent variables, and predicted increased PDA (r=.358, P=.003), fewer mean DDD (r=-.250, P=.039), and fewer alcohol-related problems (r=-.244, P=.045), as well as to the amount of improvement in all three of these variables. Six-month follow-ups have been completed, and the results are currently being analyzed.CONCLUSIONS: These results support our first experimental hypothesis but not the second or third. All groups significantly increased their PDA and decreased both their mean DDD and their alcohol-related problems, which indicates that both interventions being investigated were equally effective in helping people recover from their problem drinking.","Behavior Therapy Associates, LLC, Research Division, Albuquerque, NM 87111, United States. reidkhester@gmail.com",2013,10.2196/jmir.2565

The current guidelines for secondary prevention have focused on lifestyle modifications, risk factor control, and drug therapy. However, current data lack information on the United States population and its adherence to these guidelines. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2010, we identified those with CHD and assessed the adequacy of their adherence to the current guidelines for secondary prevention. Of 759 subjects with CHD (weighted to 12.7 million), the use of recommended therapies was 55%, 45%, and 62% for β blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and lipid-lowering agents, respectively (24% for all), with adherence lower in women than in men and in blacks and Hispanics than in whites. The nonsmoking status and control of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and, for those with diabetes, glycated hemoglobin was 73%, 67%, 59%, 60%, respectively (14% for all). Also, 17%, 70%, and 7% were at the recommended levels for physical activity, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake, respectively. Moreover, only 20% and 29% were at the recommended body mass index and waist circumference targets, respectively. Those with metabolic syndrome and diabetes were more likely to have ≥2 risk factors uncontrolled, despite being more likely to be receiving recommended therapies. A significant gap still exists between the secondary prevention guidelines and their adherence and control of CHD risk factors among United States adults. In conclusion, greater efforts are needed to ensure adherence to all aspects of secondary prevention guidelines to optimize the prognosis in subjects with CHD.","Department of Cardiovascular Disease, Zhejiang Hospital, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Heart Disease Prevention Program, School of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, California.",2013,10.1016/j.amjcard.2013.05.064
110,,23767757,The effect of history of injection drug use and alcoholism on HIV disease progression.,"The effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in preventing disease progression can be negatively influenced by the high prevalence of substance use among patients. Here, we quantify the effect of history of injection drug use and alcoholism on virologic and immunologic response to HAART. Clinical and survey data, collected at the start of HAART and at the interview date, were based on the study Longitudinal Investigations into Supportive and Ancillary Health Services (LISA) in British Columbia, Canada. Substance use was a three-level categorical variable, combining information on history of alcohol dependence and of injection drug use, defined as: no history of alcohol and injection drug use; history of alcohol or injection drug use; and history of both alcohol and injection drug use. Virologic response (pVL) was defined by ≥ 2 log10 copy/mL drop in a viral load. Immunologic response was defined as an increase in CD4 cell count percent of ≥ 100%. We used cumulative logit modeling for ordinal responses to address our objective. Of the 537 HIV-infected patients, 112 (21%) were characterized as having a history of both alcohol and injection drug use, 173 (32%) were nonadherent (&lt;95%), 196 (36%) had a CD4⁺/pVL⁺ (Best) response, 180 (34%) a CD4⁺/pVL⁻ or a CD4⁻ /pVL⁺ (Incomplete) response, and 161 (30%) a CD4⁻ /pVL⁻ (Worst) response. For individuals with history of both alcohol and injection drug use, the estimated probability of non-adherence was 0.61, and (0.15, 0.25, 0.60) of Best, Incomplete and Worse responses, respectively. Screening and detection of substance dependence will identify individuals at high-risk for nonadherence and ideally prevent their HIV disease from progressing to advanced stages where HIV disease can become difficult to manage.","a British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS , Vancouver , BC , Canada.",2013,10.1080/09540121.2013.804900
111,,23740538,Media campaigns for the prevention of illicit drug use in young people.,"BACKGROUND: Substance-specific mass media campaigns which address young people are widely used to prevent illicit drug use. They aim to reduce use and raise awareness of the problem.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in preventing or reducing the use of or intention to use illicit drugs amongst young people.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), including the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE through PubMed (from 1966 to 29 January 2013); EMBASE (from 1974 to 30 January 2013) and ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses A&amp;I (from 1861 to 3 February 2013).SELECTION CRITERIA: Cluster-randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies evaluating the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in influencing drug use, intention to use or the attitude of young people under the age of 26 towards illicit drugs.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration.MAIN RESULTS: We included 23 studies involving 188,934 young people, conducted in the USA, Canada and Australia between 1991 and 2012. Twelve studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT), two were prospective cohort studies (PCS), one study was both a RCT and a PCS, six were interrupted time series and two were controlled before and after (CBA) studies. The RCTs had an overall low risk of bias, along with the ITS (apart from the dimension 'formal test of trend'), and the PCS had overall good quality, apart from the description of loss to follow-up by exposure.Self reported or biomarker-assessed illicit drug use was measured with an array of published and unpublished scales making comparisons difficult. Pooled results of five RCTs (N = 5470) show no effect of media campaign intervention (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.12).We also pooled five ITS studies (N = 26,405) focusing specifically on methamphetamine use. Out of four pooled estimates (two endpoints measured in two age groups), there was evidence of a reduction only in past-year prevalence of methamphetamine use among 12 to 17 years old.A further five studies (designs = one RCT with PCS, two PCS, two ITS, one CBA, N = 151,508), which could not be included in meta-analyses, reported a drug use outcome with varied results including a clear iatrogenic effect in one case and reduction of use in another.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall the available evidence does not allow conclusions about the effect of media campaigns on illicit drug use among young people. We conclude that further studies are needed.","Interventions, Best Practice and Scientific Partners, European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, Lisbon, Portugal. marica.ferri@emcdda.europa.eu.",2013,10.1002/14651858.CD009287.pub2
112,,23695531,Advances in the science of adolescent drug involvement: implications for assessment and diagnosis - experience from the United States.,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by relatively high rates of substance use and substance use disorders. Precise assessment and classification of adolescent drug use behaviors are essential in gaining an accurate understanding of the nature and extent of adolescent drug use, and possible intervention or treatment needs. There has been a select group of recently published research reports and manuscripts that address critical and emerging issues pertaining to the classification and assessment of alcohol and other drug use behaviors among adolescents. An overview of these publications is provided and their clinical relevance is discussed.RECENT FINDINGS: The paper will focus on recent research, most from the United States, that addresses four main issues. One is the application of the new DSM-5 criteria to adolescents, including the advantages and disadvantages of the new criteria for substance use disorders. The second issue pertains to advances in instrumentation that provide new tools for researchers and clinicians in assessing substance use in adolescents. A significant public health issue is addressed as the third theme in the paper - screening for alcohol abuse in college settings. Finally, the paper reviews how the emerging science of brain development can inform the assessment process.SUMMARY: Recent advances in the adolescent drug abuse assessment field continue to inform clinical service and research. As a whole, these advances have strengthened the field, but continued research is needed to further refine assessment practices and standards and to better understand how to define a substance use disorder in youth.","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55454, USA. winte001@umn.edu",2013,10.1097/YCO.0b013e328361e814

This study collected pre-treatment and six months follow-up data from 12 participants on several psychological and behavioral factors related to problematic substance use, and qualitative data assessing the personal experiences of the participants six months after the retreat.FINDINGS: Statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) improvements were demonstrated for scales assessing hopefulness, empowerment, mindfulness, and quality of life meaning and outlook subscales. Self-reported alcohol, tobacco and cocaine use declined, although cannabis and opiate use did not; reported reductions in problematic cocaine use were statistically significant. All study participants reported positive and lasting changes from participating in the retreats.CONCLUSIONS: This form of ayahuasca-assisted therapy appears to be associated with statistically significant improvements in several factors related to problematic substance use among a rural aboriginal population. These findings suggest participants may have experienced positive psychological and behavioral changes in response to this therapeutic approach, and that more rigorous research of ayahuasca-assisted therapy for problematic substance use is warranted.","Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia, Canada. gthomas@okanaganresearch.com",2013,NA

The potent γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic medication vigabatrin has previously been shown to be effective in a double-blind single-site study conducted in Mexico.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vigabatrin for the treatment of cocaine dependence in a U.S. sample.DESIGN AND SETTING: Multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trial with follow-up visits at weeks 13, 16, 20, and 24 in 11 U.S. sites.PARTICIPANTS: In total, 186 treatment-seeking participants with cocaine dependence (mean age, 45 years). Approximately 67% were male, and about 60% were of African American race/ethnicity.INTERVENTIONS: Participants received twice-daily doses of vigabatrin (total dosage, 3.0 g/d) or matched placebo, plus weekly computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and biweekly individual counseling for 13 weeks. Contingency management encouraged the provision of urine samples.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the proportion of participants with cocaine abstinence during the last 2 weeks of the 12-week treatment phase as assessed by self-reports and quantitative urine drug screens. The weekly fraction of cocaine use days and the number of drug-free urine samples during weeks 1 through 13 were key secondary measures.RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the vigabatrin group and the placebo group on the primary outcome measure (P = .67), key secondary measures (P &gt; .99), or other outcome measures. However, while pill counts and self-reports indicated that more than 66% of all participants (and &gt;63% of the vigabatrin group) took more than 70% of their medication, post hoc vigabatrin urine concentration levels suggested that approximately 40% to 60% of patients taking vigabatrin may not have been adherent. This lack of adherence may have obscured any evidence of vigabatrin efficacy. No visual acuity or visual field deterioration occurred in any of the participants.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No protocol-defined differences in efficacy between vigabatrin treatment and placebo were detected for any outcome variable. This may have been due to medication nonadherence or, alternatively, due to the weak efficacy of vigabatrin.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00611130.","Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, USA. somoza@carc.uc.edu",2013,10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.872

Consecutive adult patients who smoked were enrolled at two time points, the baseline period (2009) and the post-intervention period (2009-2011). Smoking abstinence was determined by telephone interview 4 months following enrollment. Both groups implemented a multi-component intervention program. Practices randomized to the FC group could also refer patients to a follow-up support program which involved 5 telephone contacts over a 2-month period.RESULTS: Eight practices, 130 providers, and 928 eligible patients participated in the study. No statistically significant difference in 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was observed between intervention groups. There was a significant increase in referral to follow-up in both intervention groups.

The scientific evidence behind the campaign is robust and while not a complete list, provides a great deal of benefit in the reduction of cancer risk. With 12 million cancer survivors in the United States, there is a need for a parallel set of recommendations that oncologists and primary care providers may routinely use for individuals following a cancer diagnosis focused on improving the quantity and quality of life after diagnosis. With increasing survival rates and many cancer survivors dying from noncancer causes, survivorship care necessarily focuses on more than just risk of cancer recurrence and cancer-related mortality.METHODS: To provide a foundation for living a healthy life after a cancer diagnosis, we developed a set of evidence-based health messages for cancer survivors. &quot;Cancer Survivors' Eight Ways to Stay Healthy After Cancer,&quot; published by the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Jewish Hospital, documents both the evidence supporting the recommendations as well as tips for implementing them.RESULTS: The one-line summary messages are: (1) don't smoke, (2) avoid secondhand smoke, (3) exercise regularly, (4) avoid weight gain, (5) eat a healthy diet, (6) drink alcohol in moderation, if at all, (7) stay connected with friends, family, and other survivors, (8) get screening tests and go to your regular checkups.CONCLUSIONS: The cancer survivors' eight ways are the foundation for an evidence-based health promotion program for survivors.","Division of Public Health Sciences, Washington University School of Medicine and Alvin J.

Screening and brief intervention (SBI) for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use has the potential to reach a broad population of hazardous drug users but has not yet been widely adopted in Brazil's health care system. We surveyed 149 primary health care professionals in 30 clinics in Brazil who were trained to conduct SBI among their patients. We prospectively measured how often they delivered SBI to evaluate the association between organizational climate and adoption/performance of SBI.METHODS: Organizational climate was measured by the 2009 Organizational Climate Scale for Health Organizations, a scale validated in Brazil that assesses leadership, professional development, team spirit, relationship with the community, safety, strategy, and remuneration. Performance of SBI was measured prospectively by weekly assessments during the three months following training. We also assessed self-reported SBI and self-efficacy for performing SBI at three months post-training. We used inferential statistics to depict and test for the significance of associations.RESULTS: Teams with better organizational climates implemented SBI more frequently. Organizational climate factors most closely associated with SBI implementation included professional development and relationship with the community. The dimensions of leadership and remuneration were also significantly associated with SBI.CONCLUSIONS: Organizational climate may influence implementation of SBI and ultimately may affect the ability of organizations to identify and address drug use.","Federal University of Juiz de Fora -Rua José Lourenço Kelme, s/n University Campus-São Pedro, São Mateus, CEP, 36025-000, Juiz de Fora, MG, Brazil. ecruvinel@yahoo.com.br",2013,10.1186/1940-0640-8-4

This research primarily aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ondansetron at a 16mg/day dosage to treat alcohol-dependent outpatients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study was carried out at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. The total sample comprised 102 men, 18-60 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Half of our sample discontinued the treatment and the main outcome measures (proportion of abstinent days and proportion of heavy drinking days) were analyzed using the treatment adherents as well as with an imputed sample. The main factors associated with treatment retention were older age and smoking status. Although there were no significant differences between the main outcome measures of both medication groups in the adherents, ondansetron demonstrated a slight but significant superiority over the placebo regarding the proportion of heavy drinking days in the imputed sample (7.8% versus 11.7%, respectively). It appears that the optimal dosage to treat alcoholism has yet to be determined. Further, ondansetron may only be useful in treating some types of alcoholics. Ondansetron was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were registered.","Department of Psychiatry of the University of São Paulo, Brazil.",2013,10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.12.018

Drug and alcohol misuse during this critical period poses substantial problems for individual and public health, yet is highly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere. The screening, brief interventions, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model may be well-suited for identifying and intervening with adolescents who are at-risk of developing substance use disorders and those adolescents whose substance use puts them at risk for injury or illness. This article reviews the literature on SBIRT for adolescent populations, focusing on findings from randomized controlled trials. The limited evidence suggests that brief interventions may be effective with adolescents, but a number of gaps in the literature were identified. Considerations for implementing SBIRT with adolescent populations are discussed. Randomized trials are needed that have adequate statistical power, employ longer-term follow-ups, and test the effectiveness of SBIRT for adolescents in various service delivery settings.","Friends Research Institute, Inc, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. smitchell@friendsresearch.org",2013,10.1016/j.jsat.2012.11.005

However, little evidence on this relationship is available from developing countries, and recognition of this relationship may have important implications for substance demand reduction strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related problems. Latin America and the Caribbean is a rich and diverse region of the world with a large range of social and cultural influences. A working group constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Center for Addiction and Mental Health in June, 2010 identified research on this relationship as a priority area for a multinational research partnership.METHODS: This paper examines the association between self-reported child maltreatment and use in the past 12 months of alcohol and cannabis in 2294 university students in seven participating universities in six participating countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay. The research also considers the possible impact of religiosity and minimal psychological distress as factors contributing to resiliency in these samples.RESULTS: The results showed that experience of maltreatment was associated with increased use of alcohol and cannabis. However, the effects differed depending on the type of maltreatment experienced. Higher levels of religiosity were consistently associated with lower levels of alcohol and cannabis use, but we found no evidence of an impact of minimal psychological distress on these measures.CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that the experience of maltreatment may increase the risk of alcohol and cannabis use among university students in Latin American and Caribbean countries, but that higher levels of religiosity may reduce that risk. More work to determine the nature and significance of these relationships is needed.","University of the West Indies, Mona Campus, Mona, Jamaica.",2013,10.1016/j.chiabu.2012.11.002

Intervention site providers receive a combination of workshop training in evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) interventions and organizational development activities prior to conducting trauma-center-based alcohol SBI with blood-alcohol-positive injured patients. Control sites implement care as usual. Provider MI skills, patient alcohol consumption, and organizational acceptance of SBI implementation outcomes are assessed.RESULTS: The investigation has successfully recruited provider, patient and trauma center staff samples into the study, and outcomes are being followed longitudinally.CONCLUSION: When completed, the DO-SBIS trial will inform future American College of Surgeons' policy targeting the sustained integration of high-quality alcohol SBI at trauma centers nationwide.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Harborview Injury Prevention and Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Box 359911, Seattle, WA 98104, USA. dzatzick@u.washington.edu",2013,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.11.012
124,,23260338,Hepatitis C among patients with mental illness in Brazil: an analysis of associated factors.,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess factors associated with previous exposure to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Brazilian adults in mental health centers.METHOD: A cross-sectional national multicenter study of 2087 psychiatric patients randomly selected from 26 public mental health services was conducted between 2005 and 2007 in Brazil. An interview was conducted for obtaining sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral data. Psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from medical charts. Serology testing was conducted using anti-HCV. The magnitude of the associations was estimated by the prevalence rate ratio under Poisson distribution. Multivariate analysis for previous HCV exposure was carried out by weighted Poisson regression.RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of previous HCV exposure was 2.53% (95% confidence interval: 2.22-2.83). Factors associated with previous exposure to HCV infection included male gender; age ≥ 40 years; history of sexually transmitted infections; current tobacco use; lifetime injecting drug use; exchange of money/drugs for sex; and main psychiatric diagnoses of psychoses and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders or dementia.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a high prevalence of previous exposure to HCV in this population of Brazilian psychiatric patients. Most factors statistically associated with HCV were demographic or behavioral related, indicating a potential high-vulnerability profile. Screening for HCV in high-risk patients should be routine practices in these mental health services in Brazil.","Infectious Diseases Reference Center CTR-DIP Orestes Diniz, Municipal Health Division/Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil. ricardocarmo.bhz@gmail.com",2012,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.11.005
125,,23134193,"Efficacy of acamprosate for alcohol dependence in a family medicine setting in the United States: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","BACKGROUND: Acamprosate has been found to enhance rates of complete abstinence and to increase percent days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol relative to placebo treatment. As most U.S. clinical trials of acamprosate have been conducted in alcohol and other drug specialty clinics, there is a need to examine the efficacy of acamprosate in generalist settings. This study tested the efficacy of acamprosate versus placebo on the primary study outcome of PDA in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients in a family medicine setting. Secondary study outcomes included percent heavy drinking days (%HDD) and gamma glutamyltransferase level (normal or high).METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design of acamprosate was conducted in 2 family medicine settings (North Carolina and Wisconsin). One hundred volunteers were recruited primarily by advertisement, and participants were assigned to 666 mg (2 pills) oral acamprosate 3 times daily (1,998 mg/d) or matching placebo over a 12-week period. All participants concomitantly received 5 sessions of a brief behavioral intervention from a family/primary care physician.RESULTS: No significant treatment effect of acamprosate was found on PDA or the secondary outcomes. Significant treatment goal by time interaction effects was found on PDA and %HDD. Participants who had an initial goal of abstinence versus a reduction in alcohol use improved on average over time in PDA and had less %HDD from baseline to the end of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not find evidence of efficacy for acamprosate compared to placebo among alcohol-dependent individuals recruited primarily by advertisement as studied in a primary care setting. Drinking outcomes significantly improved regardless of medication condition. A goal of abstinence was significantly associated with improved drinking outcomes, suggesting that alcohol-dependent patients with such a goal may do particularly well with counseling in a family medicine setting.","Center for Addiction and Behavioral Health Research, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, WI, USA.",2012,10.1111/acer.12010
126,,23119077,Clinical preventive services in Guatemala: a cross-sectional survey of internal medicine physicians.,"BACKGROUND: Guatemala is currently undergoing an epidemiologic transition. Preventive services are key to reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases, and smoking counseling and cessation are among the most cost-effective and wide-reaching strategies. Internal medicine physicians are fundamental to providing such services, and their knowledge is a cornerstone of non-communicable disease control.METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011 to evaluate knowledge of clinical preventive services for non-communicable diseases. Interns, residents, and attending physicians of the internal medicine departments of all teaching hospitals in Guatemala completed a self-administered questionnaire. Participants' responses were contrasted with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health (MoH) prevention guidelines and the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Analysis compared knowledge of recommendations within and between hospitals.RESULTS: In response to simulated patient scenarios, all services were recommended by more than half of physicians regardless of MoH or USPSTF recommendations. Prioritization was adequate according to the MoH guidelines but not including other potentially effective services (e.g. colorectal cancer and lipid disorder screenings). With the exception of colorectal and prostate cancer screening, less frequently recommended by interns, there was no difference in recommendation rates by level.CONCLUSION: Guatemalan internal medicine physicians' knowledge on preventive services recommendations for non-communicable diseases is limited, and prioritization did not reflect cost-effectiveness. Based on these data we recommend that preventive medicine training be strengthened and development of evidence-based guidelines for low-middle income countries be a priority.","Research Department, Cardiovascular Unit of Guatemala, Guatemala City, Guatemala.",2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0048640

The type and severity of incontinence were also assessed.METHODS: This cross-sectional population-based study assessed self-reported urinary incontinence in a random sample of 1,307 women aged 25-54 years. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association of urinary incontinence with sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and other medical conditions.RESULTS: Overall, 18.4% of participants reported having involuntary loss of urine at some time within the last 12 months (95% CI, 16.4-20.7%). Among women reporting urinary incontinence, stress incontinence was the most common form (56.8%), followed by mixed (31.1%) and urge incontinence (10.0%). Approximately half of the women with urinary incontinence symptoms reported a severity index of moderate (25.8%) to severe (26.2%), with 30% stating that their leakage was extremely bothersome. Forty percent of incontinent women reported use of some sort of protection, although only 28% had ever talked to a physician about their symptoms. In adjusted analyses, high body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m(2), chronic urinary tract infections, and a history of a hysterectomy or uterine leiomyomata were associated with increased odds of reporting incontinence symptoms. Increased odds of reporting severe urinary incontinence was associated with chronic urinary tract infections, current smoking and high BMI.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that there might be a need to develop a culturally sensitive screening questionnaire in order to identify and counsel women with mild incontinence symptoms in the primary care setting.","School of Transborder Studies, Transborder Community Development and Health Unit, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. hilda.garcia@asu.edu",2012,10.1007/s00192-012-1949-y
128,,23080378,Quitline cessation counseling for young adult smokers: a randomized clinical trial.,"INTRODUCTION: One in 5 young adults in the United States currently smoke, and young adults are less likely than other smokers to make aided quit attempts. Telephone quitlines may be a useful tool for treating this population. This study tested a quitline-based smoking cessation intervention versus mailed self-help materials in smokers 18-24 years old.METHODS: This was a 2-group randomized clinical trial. The quitline-based counseling intervention (CI) included up to 4 proactive telephone counseling sessions; participants in the self-help (SH) group received only mailed cessation materials. Participants included 410 young adults who had smoked at least 1 cigarette in the past 30 days and who called the Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) for help with quitting. Primary study outcomes included whether or not a quit date was set, whether or not a serious quit attempt was undertaken, and self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 1-, 3-, and 6-month postenrollment.RESULTS: The CI and SH groups did not differ in the intent-to-treat abstinence analyses at any of the follow-ups. However, the CI group was significantly more likely to set a quit date at 1-month postenrollment. Follow-up response rates were low (67.8% at 1 month; 53.4% at 3 months; and 48.3% at 6 months) reflecting lower motivation to participate in this kind of research.CONCLUSIONS: Relative to self-help, quitline counseling motivated young adults to set a quit date but abstinence rates were not improved. Research is needed on how to motivate young adult smokers to seek cessation treatment including quitline services.","Department of Pediatrics and Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (CTRI), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health (UWSMPH), Madison, WI 53711, USA.",2012,10.1093/ntr/nts227
129,,23007881,Behavioral counseling after screening for alcohol misuse in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.,"BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse, which includes the full spectrum from risky drinking to alcohol dependence, is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States.PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescents and adults who misuse alcohol.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and reference lists of published literature (January 1985 through January 2012, limited to English-language articles).STUDY SELECTION: Controlled trials at least 6 months' duration that enrolled persons with alcohol misuse identified by screening in primary care settings and evaluated behavioral counseling interventions.DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted data and a second checked accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned quality ratings and graded the strength of the evidence.DATA SYNTHESIS: The 23 included trials generally excluded persons with alcohol dependence. The best evidence was for brief (10- to 15-minute) multicontact interventions. Among adults receiving behavioral interventions, consumption decreased by 3.6 drinks per week from baseline (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/wk [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8 drinks/wk]; 10 trials; 4332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported heavy drinking episodes (risk difference, 0.12 [CI, 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 trials; 2737 participants), and 11% more adults reported drinking less than the recommended limits (risk difference, 0.11 [CI, 0.08 to 0.13]; 9 trials; 5973 participants) over 12 months compared with control participants (moderate strength of evidence). Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about accidents, injuries, or alcohol-related liver problems. Trials enrolling young adults or college students showed reduced consumption and fewer heavy drinking episodes (moderate strength of evidence). Little or no evidence of harms was found.LIMITATIONS: Results may be biased to the null because the behavior of control participants could have been affected by alcohol misuse assessments. In addition, evidence is probably inapplicable to persons with alcohol dependence and selective reporting may have occurred.CONCLUSION: Behavioral counseling interventions improve behavioral outcomes for adults with risky drinking.PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.","University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Department of Medicine, 5034 Old Clinic Building, CB 7110, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. daniel_jonas@med.unc.edu",2012,NA

Physical therapists have a practice pattern conducive to HP, including lifestyle behavior change. The extent to which HP content is included in entry-level physical therapy (PT) curricula, and how it is taught however, is unknown. The aim of this study was to benchmark lifestyle behavior HP content within entry-level curricula of international PT programs. The sampling frame included 258 accredited PT academic programs spanning six countries. An internet-based survey was used to assess HP curricular content. Descriptive questions for HP topics (smoking cessation, nutrition, weight control, alcohol consumption, exercise, and stress management) included hours allotted and instructional methods used. Chi square tests examined differences between the proportion of programs in the United States (US) and other countries (combined) for HP topics, and among HP topics regarding instructional methods. The response rate was 48 %. Most programs (&gt;80 %) included all HP topics except alcohol consumption (65.5 % of programs). Instructional methods used were primarily theory-based; few programs (range 2.6-24.1 %) combined theory, practical and attainment of clinical competency for all HP topics (exercise prescription notwithstanding). Proportionally, more US programs included alcohol and nutrition than other countries combined. Overall, HP lifestyle behavior topics were included to varying extent; however, instructional methods used and hours allotted per topic varied across PT curricula. Universal standards of HP practice as a clinical competency are warranted within the profession.","School of Human Kinetics, Trinity Western University, 7600 Glover Road, Langley, BC, V2Y 1Y1, Canada, mike.bodner@twu.ca.",2012,10.1007/s10459-012-9404-x
131,,22972147,Motivational interviewing for improving outcomes in youth living with HIV.,"BACKGROUND: Almost half of all the new HIV infections occur in youth. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counselling technique that is effective in bringing about positive behavior changes in the general population. It is unclear whether it can be used to improve outcomes in youth living with HIV.OBJECTIVES: To determine whether MI is effective in improving outcomes in youth living with HIV.SEARCH METHODS: We used a comprehensive and exhaustive strategy in an attempt to identify all relevant studies, regardless of language or publication status, in electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO), conference proceedings and specialised databases from January 1980 to March 2012.SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which youth (aged 10 to 24) living with HIV received MI, singly or in combination with another intervention compared to any other intervention, and reporting on the outcomes of interest (adherence to medication, mortality, quality of life, viral load, CD4-positive-T-lymphocyte count, progression to AIDS, retention in care, substance abuse and condom use). All settings were considered.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified 863 references.Two authors independently examined the titles and abstracts of all identified trials, of which 28 full-text articles were closely screened for eligibility based on criteria established a-priori. The included studies were appraised for quality in duplicate. Data were extracted using a pre-tested and standardised form. No meta-analyses were performed.MAIN RESULTS: Two trials located in the United States, reported in four papers met our inclusion criteria. They enrolled a total of 237 participants and compared motivational interviewing singly to standard of care. None of these trials reported on adherence to HIV medication, mortality or quality of life. Both trials reported reductions in viral load (in the short term) and unprotected sexual acts. A reduction in alcohol use was identified only in one of two studies that reported on this outcome. One trial reported on retention. Retention rates were not affected by the intervention.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence, coming from two trials which suggests that MI is effective in reducing short term viral load and unprotected sexual acts. There is moderate quality evidence from one trial that MI is effective in reducing alcohol use. There is a need for more trials which report on outcomes such as adherence to medication, mortality and quality of life in youth.","Centre for the Development of Best Practices in Health, Yaoundé Central Hospital, Yaoundé, Cameroon. mbuagblc@mcmaster.ca",2012,10.1002/14651858.CD009748.pub2

We included all studies reporting adherence rates as a primary or secondary outcome among HIV-infected pregnant women. Two independent reviewers extracted data on adherence and study characteristics. A random-effects model was used to pool adherence rates; sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were assessed.RESULTS: Of 72 eligible articles, 51 studies involving 20 153 HIV-infected pregnant women were included. Most studies were from United States (n =  14, 27%) followed by Kenya (n = 6, 12%), South Africa (n = 5, 10%), and Zambia (n = 5, 10%). The threshold defining good adherence to ART varied across studies (&gt;80, &gt;90, &gt;95, 100%). A pooled analysis of all studies indicated a pooled estimate of 73.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 69.3-77.5%] of pregnant women who had adequate (&gt;80%) ART adherence. The pooled proportion of women with adequate adherence levels was higher during the antepartum (75.7%, 95% CI 71.5-79.7%) than during postpartum (53.0%, 95% CI 32.8-72.7%; P = 0.005). Selected reported barriers for nonadherence included physical, economic and emotional stresses, depression (especially postdelivery), alcohol or drug use, and ART dosing frequency or pill burden.CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that only 73.5% of pregnant women achieved optimal ART adherence. Reaching adequate ART adherence levels was a challenge in pregnancy, but especially during the postpartum period.

FASDs can be prevented by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy; however, efforts to prevent risky alcohol consumption in women of childbearing potential have not been universally successful.OBJECTIVES: Data suggest that successful interventions may require tailoring methods to meet the needs of specific populations and cultures. Key findings of interventions previously tested among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women who are or may become pregnant, data gaps, and promising ongoing interventions are reviewed.METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature on empirically based interventions among AI/AN women was conducted. Selected alternative approaches currently being tested in AI/AN settings are also described.RESULTS: Similar to findings among other populations of women in the United States, a number of interventions have been implemented; however, only a small number have measured results. Approaches have included standard interventions involving hospitalization, inpatient, or outpatient care; wellness education; traditional approaches; and case management for high-risk women. An ongoing Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol comparing the effectiveness of a web-based culturally adapted tool, or a peer health educator model to standard clinical practice is described.CONCLUSION: Translation of successful interventions from other settings to AI/AN populations holds promise.SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: FASDs represent a significant health issue with high personal and societal costs.

134,,22920991,A randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an interactive mobile messaging intervention for underserved smokers: Project ACTION.,"BACKGROUND: Despite a significant decrease in smoking prevalence over the past ten years, cigarette smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. Moreover, smoking prevalence is significantly higher among those with low levels of education and those living at, or below, the poverty level. These groups tend to be confronted with significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation intervention approaches. The purpose of the study, Project ACTION (Adult smoking Cessation Treatment through Innovative Outreach to Neighborhoods), is to utilize a mobile clinic model, a network of community sites (i.e., community centers and churches) and an interactive mobile messaging system to reach and deliver smoking cessation treatment to underserved, low-income communities.DESIGN: We are using a group-randomized design, with the community site as the sampling unit, to compare the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions: 1) Standard Care--brief advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help materials; 2) Enhanced Care--standard care components plus a cell phone-delivered text/graphical messaging component; and 3) Intensive Care--enhanced care components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling sessions. An economic evaluation will also be performed to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of the three treatment approaches. We will recruit 756 participants (252 participants in each of the 3 intervention groups). At the time of randomization, participants complete a baseline assessment, consisting of smoking history, socio-demographic, and psychosocial variables. Monthly cell phone assessments are conducted for 6 months-post enrollment, and a final 12-month follow-up is conducted at the original neighborhood site of enrollment. We will perform mixed-model logistic regression to compare the efficacy of the three smoking cessation intervention treatment groups.DISCUSSION: It is hypothesized that the intensive care approach will most successfully address the needs of the target population and result in the highest smoking cessation rates. In addition to increasing cessation rates, the intervention offers several features (including neighborhood outreach and use of mHealth technology) that are likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant engagement and retention to treatment.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized controlled trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT00948129.","Department of Behavioral Science, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, P.O.

The recommendations also address brief alcohol screening, as alcohol accelerates progression of liver disease among HCV-infected individuals. These recommendations augment CDC's 1998 and 1999 recommendations based on risk and medical indications and are not meant to replace those recommendations.METHODS: These recommendations are based on systematic reviews of evidence published from 1995 through February 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects. Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during 1945-1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Viral Hepatitis, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",2012,NA
136,,22895429,Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection among persons born during 1945-1965.,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Many of the 2.7-3.9 million persons living with HCV infection are unaware they are infected and do not receive care (e.g., education, counseling, and medical monitoring) and treatment. CDC estimates that although persons born during 1945-1965 comprise an estimated 27% of the population, they account for approximately three fourths of all HCV infections in the United States, 73% of HCV-associated mortality, and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and other HCV-related liver disease. With the advent of new therapies that can halt disease progression and provide a virologic cure (i.e., sustained viral clearance following completion of treatment) in most persons, targeted testing and linkage to care for infected persons in this birth cohort is expected to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. CDC is augmenting previous recommendations for HCV testing (CDC. Recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease. MMWR 1998;47[No. RR-19]) to recommend one-time testing without prior ascertainment of HCV risk for persons born during 1945-1965, a population with a disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Persons identified as having HCV infection should receive a brief screening for alcohol use and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate care for HCV infection and related conditions. These recommendations do not replace previous guidelines for HCV testing that are based on known risk factors and clinical indications. Rather, they define an additional target population for testing: persons born during 1945-1965. CDC developed these recommendations with the assistance of a work group representing diverse expertise and perspectives. The recommendations are informed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, an approach that provides guidance and tools to define the research questions, conduct the systematic review, assess the overall quality of the evidence, and determine strength of the recommendations. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health-care professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services. These recommendations will be reviewed every 5 years and updated to include advances in the published evidence.","Division of Viral Hepatitis, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, USA. bsmith6@cdc.gov",2012,NA
137,,22852832,Comparative effectiveness of post-discharge interventions for hospitalized smokers: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: A hospital admission offers smokers an opportunity to quit. Smoking cessation counseling provided in the hospital is effective, but only if it continues for more than one month after discharge. Providing smoking cessation medication at discharge may add benefit to counseling. A major barrier to translating this research into clinical practice is sustaining treatment during the transition to outpatient care. An evidence-based, practical, cost-effective model that facilitates the continuation of tobacco treatment after discharge is needed. This paper describes the design of a comparative effectiveness trial testing a hospital-initiated intervention against standard care.DESIGN: A two-arm randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness of standard post-discharge care with a multi-component smoking cessation intervention provided for three months after discharge. Current smokers admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital who receive bedside smoking cessation counseling, intend to quit after discharge and are willing to consider smoking cessation medication are eligible. Study participants are recruited following the hospital counseling visit and randomly assigned to receive Standard Care or Extended Care after hospital discharge. Standard Care includes a recommendation for a smoking cessation medication and information about community resources. Extended Care includes up to three months of free FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and five proactive computerized telephone calls that use interactive voice response technology to provide tailored motivational messages, offer additional live telephone counseling calls from a smoking cessation counselor, and facilitate medication refills. Outcomes are assessed at one, three, and six months after hospital discharge. The primary outcomes are self-reported and validated seven-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at six months. Other outcomes include short-term and sustained smoking cessation, post-discharge utilization of smoking cessation treatment, hospital readmissions and emergency room visits, and program cost per quit.DISCUSSION: This study tests a disseminable smoking intervention model for hospitalized smokers. If effective and widely adopted, it could help to reduce population smoking rates and thereby reduce tobacco-related mortality, morbidity, and health care costs.TRIAL REGISTRATION: United States Clinical Trials Registry NCT01177176.","Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, USA.",2012,10.1186/1745-6215-13-124

Pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for thyroid cancer were estimated from mutually adjusted models of cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, which were additionally adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status, body mass index, and cohort.RESULTS: Over follow-up, 1,003 incident thyroid cancer cases (335 men and 668 women) were identified. Compared to never smokers, current smoking was associated with reduced risk of thyroid cancer (HR = 0.68, 95 % CI 0.55-0.85); this association was slightly stronger among non-drinkers (HR = 0.46, 95 % CI 0.29-0.74). No reduction in risk was observed for former, compared to never, smokers. Greater smoking intensity, duration, and pack-years were associated with further reductions in risk among former and current smokers. Alcohol intake was also inversely associated with thyroid cancer risk (≥7 drinks/week versus 0, HR = 0.72, 95 % CI 0.58-0.90, p trend = 0.002). Inverse associations with smoking and alcohol were more pronounced for papillary versus follicular tumors.CONCLUSION: The results of this pooled analysis suggest that both cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with reduced risks of papillary thyroid cancer and, possibly, follicular thyroid cancer.","Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, EPS 7056, 6120 Executive Blvd, Rockville, MD 20852, USA. kitaharac@mail.nih.gov",2012,10.1007/s10552-012-0039-2

At age 45 years, the lifetime risk of cancer death for male smokers is 27.7 % (95 % CI 24.0-31.4 %) compared to 15.8 % (95 % CI 12.7-18.9 %) for male non-smokers. At age 45 years, the lifetime risk of cancer death for female smokers is 21.7 % (95 % CI 18.8-24.6 %) compared to 13.2 % (95 % CI 11.0-15.4 %) for female non-smokers. Remaining lifetime risk for cancer death declined with age, and men have a greater risk for cancer death compared to women. Adjustment for competing risk of death, particularly representing cardiovascular mortality, yielded a greater change in lifetime risk estimates for men and smokers compared to women and non-smokers.CONCLUSIONS: At the population level, the lifetime risk for cancer death remains significantly higher for smokers compared to non-smokers, regardless of sex. These estimates may provide clinicians with useful information for counseling individual patients and highlight the need for continued public health efforts related to smoking cessation.","Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 680 N.

The sample comprised 847 substance-using adults who were recruited from 12 outpatient substance abuse treatment settings across the United States. Alcohol and drug use disorders were assessed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Checklist. Data were analyzed by factor analysis, item response theory (IRT), sensitivity and specificity procedures.RESULTS: Comparatively prevalent symptoms of dependence, especially inability to cut down for all substances, showed high sensitivity for detecting an SUD (low rate of false negative). IRT-defined severe (infrequent) and low discriminative items, especially withdrawal for alcohol, cannabis and cocaine, had low sensitivity in identifying cases of an SUD. IRT-defined less severe (frequent) and high discriminative items, including inability to cut down or taking larger amounts than intended for all substances and withdrawal for amphetamines and opioids, showed good-to-high values of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in classifying cases and noncases of an SUD.CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the feasibility of identifying psychometrically reliable substance dependence symptoms to develop a two-item screen for alcohol and drug disorders.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, School of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA. litzy.wu@duke.edu",2012,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2012.06.014

Little is known about the co-morbidity of substance use disorders (SUD) and other psychiatric disorders of mothers who use MA prenatally. The Infant Development, Environment and Lifestyle (IDEAL) Study is a prospective, investigation of prenatal MA use and child outcome in the United States (US) and New Zealand (NZ). This study examined prenatal MA use and the co-morbidity of SUD and psychiatric disorders at 1-month postpartum.METHOD: Mothers who used MA (US=127, NZ=97) were compared to a matched comparison group (US=193, NZ=110). The Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory-3 was used to measure the probability of a SUD. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was used to measure the likelihood of a positive diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder.RESULTS: In the US and NZ, MA groups had lower SES, increased single parenting, delayed prenatal care, and increased polydrug use. In the US only, MA mothers had lower income than the comparison group. MA users were 10 times more likely to have a SUD and twice as likely to meet BSI criteria for a diagnosable psychiatric disorder. In NZ, but not the US, MA users were five times more likely to have co-morbidity of both. This disparity may be due to higher quantities of prenatal alcohol use associated with increased psychiatric symptoms.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that addressing both substance abuse and psychiatric disorders in mothers who use MA may be required to effectively treat maternal MA use.","Department of Psychological Medicine, Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. t.wouldes@auckland.ac.nz",2012,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2012.06.016

It also examines whether family-focused preventive interventions buffer predictive relationships.DESIGN: Data were from a randomized prevention trial extending from ages 11 to 21 years.SETTING: Families of sixth graders enrolled in 33 rural schools in the Midwestern United States were invited to participate.PARTICIPANTS: Families (n = 667) were pretested and assigned randomly to a control group (n = 208) or to family interventions (n = 459). The average age of participating youth was 11.3 years when the study began (52% female).MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaire data were collected on alcohol dimensions during adolescence (early onset, alcohol use, alcohol problems) and young adulthood (alcohol abuse), and on risk factors in early adolescence (male gender, impulsive behaviors, aggression-hostility, peer deviance and parent problem drinking).FINDINGS: Impulsive behaviors predicted early onset, peer deviance predicted alcohol use and parent problem drinking predicted alcohol problems (P &lt; 0.05). Aggression-hostility and alcohol problems predicted alcohol abuse in the control group (P &lt; 0.05), but not in the family interventions group (P &gt; 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Different dimensions of alcohol use and problems from before age 13 to young adulthood are predicted by different risk factors. Family-focused preventive interventions can reduce the influence of some of these risk factors, including early adolescent aggression-hostility and late adolescent alcohol problems.","Boys Town National Research Institute for Child and Family Studies, Boys Town, NE 68010, USA. masonwa@boystown.org",2012,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2012.03987.x

However, physicians lack sufficient skill in counseling patients to change behaviors. Characterizing effective published curricular interventions for behavior change counseling for medical trainees would inform educators toward improved training.METHOD: The authors conducted a systematic literature search of studies published between 1965 and 2011 evaluating curricula on behavior change counseling for medical trainees. Included studies described behavior change counseling, teaching interventions for medical trainees, and assessment of interventions. The authors extracted eligible articles, rated outcomes for learners and patients using Kirkpatrick's hierarchy, and determined study quality.RESULTS: Of 2,788 identified citations, 109 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were performed in the United States (98), 93 at a single institution, and 81 in primary care settings. Curricular topics for counseling included smoking (67 studies), nutrition (30), alcohol/drug use (26), and exercise (22). Although most studies did not include theoretical frameworks, 39 used the Transtheoretical Model of Change. Sixty-two studies involved eight or fewer hours of curricular time, and 51 spanned four or fewer weeks. The studies with highest-level outcomes and quality employed multiple curricular techniques and included practice of counseling techniques in either simulated or actual clinical settings.CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature suggests that trainees learn behavior change counseling through active, realistic practice and implementation of reminder and feedback systems within actual clinical practice settings. Multiinstitutional medical education research on methods of teaching behavior change counseling that influence patients' health outcomes are needed to ensure trainees' clinical competence and improve patient care.","Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA 94143-0120, USA. karen.hauer@ucsf.edu",2012,10.1097/ACM.0b013e31825837be

An internet-based, tailored intervention based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change was delivered to middle school students to reduce alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. This internet-based approach requires very little faculty and staff time, which is efficient given curricular demands.METHODS: Twenty-two middle schools in the United States were matched and randomly assigned to either the intervention or control conditions (N=1590 students who had ever used substances). Participants received one pre-test assessment, three thirty-minute intervention sessions over three months, and two post-test assessments (3 and 14 months after pre-test, respectively).RESULTS: Random effects logistic models showed significant treatment effects for the intervention group when compared to the control group at the 3-month post-test.CONCLUSIONS: This program has the potential to be applied as stand-alone practice or as part of more intensive interventions to promote substance use cessation.","Pro-Change Behavior Systems, Inc., P.O.

145,,22587894,"Effectiveness of brief interventions as part of the screening, brief intervention and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for reducing the non-medical use of psychoactive substances: a systematic review protocol.","BACKGROUND: There is a significant public health burden associated with substance use in Canada. The early detection and/or treatment of risky substance use has the potential to dramatically improve outcomes for those who experience harms from the non-medical use of psychoactive substances, particularly adolescents whose brains are still undergoing development. The Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment model is a comprehensive, integrated approach for the delivery of early intervention and treatment services for individuals experiencing substance use-related harms, as well as those who are at risk of experiencing such harm.METHODS: This article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of brief interventions as part of the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment model for reducing the non-medical use of psychoactive substances. Studies will be selected in which brief interventions target non-medical psychoactive substance use (excluding alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine) among those 12 years and older who are opportunistically screened and deemed at risk of harms related to psychoactive substance use. We will include one-on-one verbal interventions and exclude non-verbal brief interventions (for example, the provision of information such as a pamphlet or online interventions) and group interventions. Primary, secondary and adverse outcomes of interest are prespecified. Randomized controlled trials will be included; non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after studies and interrupted time series designs will be considered in the absence of randomized controlled trials. We will search several bibliographic databases (for example, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CORK) and search sources for grey literature. We will meta-analyze studies where possible. We will conduct subgroup analyses, if possible, according to drug class and intervention setting.DISCUSSION: This review will provide evidence on the effectiveness of brief interventions as part of the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment protocol aimed at the non-medical use of psychoactive substances and may provide guidance as to where future research might be most beneficial.","Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse (CCSA), 75 Albert Street, Ottawa, ON, K1P 5E7, Canada. myoung@ccsa.ca",2012,10.1186/2046-4053-1-22
146,,22569211,Protocol of a randomized controlled trial of the Tobacco Tactics website for operating engineers.,"BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates that 35 percent of blue-collar workers in the US currently smoke while only 20 percent of white-collar workers smoke. Over the last year, we have been working with heavy equipment operators, specifically the Local 324 Training Center of the International Union of Operating Engineers, to study the epidemiology of smoking, which is 29% compared to 21% among the general population. For the current study funded by the National Cancer Institute (1R21CA152247-01A1), we have developed the Tobacco Tactics website which will be compared to the state supported 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone line. Outcome evaluation will compare those randomized to the Tobacco Tactics web-based intervention to those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW control condition on: a) 30-day and 6-month quit rates; b) cotinine levels; c) cigarettes smoked/day; d) number of quit attempts; and e) nicotine addiction. Process evaluation will compare the two groups on the: a) contacts with intervention; b) medications used; c) helpfulness of the nurse/coach; and d) willingness to recommend the intervention to others.DESIGN: This will be a randomized controlled trial (N = 184). Both interventions will be offered during regularly scheduled safety training at Local 324 Training Center of the International Union of Operating Engineers and both will include optional provision of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy and the same number of telephone contacts. However, the Tobacco Tactics website has graphics tailored to Operating Engineers, tailored cessation feedback from the website, and follow up nurse counseling offered by multimedia options including phone and/or email, and/or e-community. Primary Analysis of Aim 1 will be conducted by using logistic regression to compare smoking habits (e.g., quit rates) of those in the intervention arm to those in the control arm. Primary analyses for Aim 2 will compare process measures (e.g., medications used) between the two groups by linear, logistic, and Poisson regression.DISCUSSION: Dissemination of an efficacious work-site, web-based smoking cessation intervention has the potential to substantially impact cancer rates among this population. Based on the outcome of this smaller study, wider scale testing in conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which services Operating Engineers across North America (including US, Mexico, and Canada) will be conducted.TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01124110.","Department of Psychiatry, Ann Arbor VA Center for Clinical Management Research, The University of Michigan, School of Nursing, P.O.

Establishing estimates is essential to determine the scope, public health impact, and psychiatric sequelae of sexual revictimization.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD among 3 national female samples (adolescent, college, and adult household probability).DESIGN: Surveys were used to collect data from the National Women's Study-Replication (2006; college) as well as household probability samples from the National Survey of Adolescents-Replication (2005) and the National Women's Study-Replication (2006; household probability).SETTING: Households and college campuses across the United States.PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred sixty-three adolescent girls, 2000 college women, and 3001 household-residing adult women.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behaviorally specific questions assessed unwanted sexual acts occurring over the life span owing to the use of force, threat of force, or incapacitation via drug or alcohol use. Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed with a module validated against the criterion standard Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV.RESULTS: About 53% of victimized adolescents, 50% of victimized college women, and 58.8% of victimized household-residing women reported sexual revictimization. Current PTSD was reported by 20% of revictimized adolescents, 40% of revictimized college women, and 27.2% of revictimized household-residing women. Compared with nonvictims, odds of meeting past 6-month PTSD were 4.3 to 8.2 times higher for revictimized respondents and 2.4 to 3.5 times higher for single victims.CONCLUSIONS: Population prevalence estimates suggest that 769 000 adolescent girls, 625 000 college women, and 13.4 million women in US households reported sexual revictimization. Further, 154 000 sexually revictimized adolescents, 250 000 sexually revictimized college women, and 3.6 million sexually revictimized household women met criteria for past 6-month PTSD. Findings highlight the importance of screening for sexual revictimization and PTSD in pediatric, college, and primary care settings.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29455, USA. walsk@musc.edu",2012,NA

Strategies are therefore needed to reduce these risk behaviors among all emergency department (ED) patients who use drugs, regardless of route of administration. Although recent articles have focused on the opportunity for early HIV detection and treatment through an array of ED screening and testing strategies, the effect of voluntary HIV testing and brief counseling (VT/C) on the sexual behaviors of out-of-treatment drug users over time has not yet been reported.METHODS: From November 2004 to May 2008, the study screened 46,208 urban ED patients aged 18 to 54 years; 2,148 (4.6%) reported cocaine or heroin use within 30 days, 1,538 met eligibility criteria (Drug Abuse Severity Test [DAST] scores ≥3 and were either English- or Spanish-speaking), and 1,030 were enrolled. These data were obtained in the course of a randomized, controlled trial (Project SAFE) of a brief motivational intervention focused on reducing risky sexual behaviors. Although the intervention itself did not demonstrate any differential effect on the number or percentage of unprotected sexual acts, both control and intervention group participants received baseline VT/C and referral for drug treatment as part of the study protocol. This study is a report of a secondary analysis of cohort data to describe changes in sexual behaviors over time among drug users after the VT/C and referral.RESULTS: The mean (±SD) age of enrollees was 35.8 (±8.4) years; 67% were male, 39% were non-Hispanic black or African American, 41% were white non-Hispanic, and 19% were Hispanic. Half injected drugs, and 53% met criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At baseline testing, 8.8% were HIV-positive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Follow-ups were conducted at 6 and 12 months, with an attrition rate of 22%. Known HIV-positive patients accounted for 84 of 1,030 cases (8.1%), and 13 new cases were discovered: 7 of 946 at were discovered at the baseline contact (0.74%), 2 of 655 were discovered at 6 months (0.3%), and 4 of 706 (0.57%) were discovered at the 12-month contact. Twelve of the 13 returned for confirmatory testing and were actively enrolled in our infectious disease clinic. For all partners, there was a reduction in the percentage of unprotected sex acts over time (p &lt; 0.0001), with decreases at 6 months versus baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.60 to 0.83), sustained at 12 months versus baseline (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.58 to 0.82). For the outcome of percentage of sex acts while high, there was also a significant reduction over time (p &lt; 0.0001), with a drop-off at 6 months versus baseline (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.37) that was sustained at 12 months (OR vs. baseline 0.25, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.30). In an adjusted model, male sex, older age, and HIV positivity predicted significant declines over time in the likelihood of unprotected sexual acts. Older age and higher baseline drug severity predicted significant decreases over time in the likelihood of sex acts while high.CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary testing and counseling for HIV or sexually transmitted infections, accompanied by referral to drug treatment, for this population of ED cocaine and heroin users was associated with reduction in unprotected sex acts and fewer sex acts while high.","Department of Emergency Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston Medical Center, MA, USA. ebernste@bu.edu",2012,10.1111/j.1553-2712.2012.01314.x
149,,22496352,Reach and effectiveness of mailed nicotine replacement therapy for smokers: 6-month outcomes in a naturalistic exploratory study.,"BACKGROUND: There are important inequities in smoker access to clinic-based smoking cessation services. Low barrier high-reach interventions are proposed as solutions to these inequities. Although effective, telephone quitlines, which provide multi-session counselling but no medication, have low utilization with high attrition. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), brief advice and self-help materials on quit attempts and 6-month quit rates in motivated smokers.METHODS: In this open-label naturalistic study, 14,000 treatments of 5 weeks in duration of either nicotine patch (n=10,000) or nicotine gum (n=4000) were made available to all eligible adult smokers in Ontario, Canada, who called a toll-free number to register with the STOP (Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients) Study and receive a single brief intervention. The primary outcome measure was self-reported abstinence rates at 6 months post-treatment among STOP participants. These data were compared with quit rates that were reported in a concurrent no-intervention cohort of Ontario smokers matched for eligibility.RESULTS: 16 405 callers were assessed and 13143 eligible participants were mailed a treatment package with 5 weeks of NRT (choice of patch or gum), self-help and community resource materials. Among the 6261 participants who consented to follow-up, 2601 (42%) had complete follow-up data. Of those with complete follow-up data, the percentage reporting abstinence after 6 months in the treatment cohort was 21.4%, relative to 11.6% in the no-intervention cohort (rate ratio of 1.84; 95% CI 1.79 to 1.89), with the 30-day point prevalence of 17.8% and 9.8% for the intervention and no-intervention cohorts, respectively (rate ratio 1.81; CI 1.75 to 1.87).CONCLUSIONS: Provision of free NRT by mail following a brief telephone intervention is an effective strategy to reach and assist a large number of smokers making a quit attempt.","Addictions Program, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 33 Russell Street, Toronto, ON M5S 2S1, Canada.",2012,10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050303
150,,22406192,Tobacco dependence counseling in a randomized multisite clinical trial.,"Pharmacotherapy trials for treating tobacco dependence would benefit from behavioral interventions providing treatment consistent with clinical practice guidelines but not directing participants to treatments not evaluated in the trial. The Smoke Free and Living It© behavioral intervention manual includes participant and interventionist guides and is designed to provide both practical counseling and intra-treatment support. We utilized this intervention manual in a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of smokers with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. In this study, we evaluated how the interventional manual performed in a &quot;train-the-trainer&quot; model requiring uniform counseling across 6 sites and 15 interventionists. We analyzed the skill-adherence of the interventionists and the intervention-adherence of the participants. The 255 randomized participants completed 9.3±2.8 sessions (mean±SD), with 157 participants (61.6%) completing all 11 of the sessions and 221 (86.7%) completing at least 6 of the 11 sessions. Of the 163 sessions for which the study interventionists were evaluated, 156 (95.7%) were rated as adherent to protocol and &quot;meeting expectations&quot; on at least 6 of 7 established criteria, illustrating that fidelity can be maintained with minimal supervision. The self-help and interventionists guides of the Smoke Free and Living It manual can thus be used to provide behavioral intervention with a high rate of adherence by both the interventionists and the participants. This manual meets the requirements of the United States Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline, can be adapted to specific research protocols, and provides a useful option for behavioral intervention during clinical trials for smoking cessation.","Nicotine Dependence Center Research Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. croghan.ivana@mayo.edu",2012,10.1016/j.cct.2012.02.014

Eligibility for receiving care based on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services performance measures was determined for assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF; n = 60,601), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) if LVEF&lt;40% and no contraindications (24,130), discharge instructions (49,383), and smoking cessation counseling (10,152). Patient and hospital characteristics that were significantly associated with performance measures in univariate analyses were entered into multivariate logistic regression models.RESULTS: Overall, documentation for LVEF assessment was noted in 95%, ACEi/ARB use in 87%, discharge instruction in 82%, and smoking cessation counseling in 91% of eligible patients. In adjusted analyses, older patients and those with evidence of renal failure were significantly less likely to receive each care measure except for discharge instructions (no age effect). Patients with higher body mass index were more likely to receive ACEi/ARB and discharge instructions but less likely to have LVEF documented or to receive smoking cessation counseling. Small hospitals (&lt;200 beds) were less likely to provide each of the performance measures compared with larger hospitals.CONCLUSION: Recommended heart failure care is less likely in patients with certain characteristics (older age and abnormal renal function) and those cared for in smaller hospitals. Programs to improve evidence-based care for heart failure should consider interventions specifically targeting and tailored to smaller facilities and patients who are older with comorbidities.","Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, CA, USA. heiden@stanford.edu",2012,10.1016/j.ahj.2011.10.008

The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between prescriber and/or patient characteristics and subsequent prescription of warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).METHODS: Observational studies conducted in the US using multivariate analysis to determine the relationship between characteristics and the odds of receiving warfarin for stroke prevention were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE and a manual review of references. Effect estimates of prescriber and/or patient characteristics from individual studies were pooled to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies reporting results of 33 unique multivariate analyses were identified. Warfarin use across studies ranged from 9.1%-79.8% (median=49.1%). There was a moderately-strong correlation between warfarin use and year of study (r=0.60, p=0.002). Upon meta-analysis, characteristics associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of warfarin use included history of cerebrovascular accident (OR=1.59), heart failure (OR=1.36), and male gender (OR=1.12). Those associated with a significant reduction in the odds of warfarin use included alcohol/drug abuse (OR=0.62), perceived barriers to compliance (OR=0.87), contraindication(s) to warfarin (OR=0.81), dementia (OR=0.32), falls (OR=0.60), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR=0.47), intracranial hemorrhage (OR=0.39), hepatic (OR=0.59), and renal impairment (OR=0.69). While age per 10-year increase (OR=0.78) and advancing age as a dichotomized variable (cut-off varied by study) (OR=0.57) were associated with significant reductions in warfarin use; qualitative review of results of studies evaluating age as a categorical variable did not confirm this relationship.CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use has increased somewhat over time. The decision to prescribe warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation is based upon multiple prescriber and patient characteristics. These findings can be used by family practice prescribers and other healthcare decision-makers to target interventions or methods to improve utilization of warfarin when it is indicated for stroke prevention.","Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, 69 North Eagleville Road, Storrs, CT 06268, USA.",2012,10.1186/1471-2296-13-5

In this study, we tested the effects of telephone counseling for smoking cessation in Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese-speaking smokers.METHODS: A culturally tailored counseling protocol was developed in English and translated into Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. We conducted a single randomized trial embedded in the California quitline service. Smokers who called the quitline's Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese telephone lines between August 2, 2004, and April 4, 2008, were recruited to the trial. Subjects (N = 2277) were stratified by language and randomly assigned to telephone counseling (self-help materials and up to six counseling sessions; n = 1124 subjects) or self-help (self-help materials only; n = 1153 subjects) groups: 729 Chinese subjects (counseling = 359, self-help = 370), 848 Korean subjects (counseling = 422, self-help = 426), and 700 Vietnamese subjects (counseling = 343, self-help = 357). The primary outcome was 6-month prolonged abstinence. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to estimate prolonged abstinence rates for all subjects and for each language group. All statistical tests were two-sided.RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, counseling increased the 6-month prolonged abstinence rate among all smokers compared with self-help (counseling vs self-help, 16.4% vs 8.0%, difference = 8.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.7% to 11.1%, P &lt; .001). Counseling also increased the 6-month prolonged abstinence rate for each language group compared with self-help (counseling vs self-help, Chinese, 14.8% vs 6.0%, difference = 8.8%, 95% CI = 4.4% to 13.2%, P &lt; .001; Korean, 14.9% vs 5.2%, difference = 9.7%, 95% CI = 5.8% to 13.8%, P &lt; .001; Vietnamese, 19.8% vs 13.5%, difference = 6.3%, 95% CI = 0.9% to 11.9%, P = .023).CONCLUSIONS: Telephone counseling was effective for Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese-speaking smokers.

154,,22221594,Topiramate for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction: a multi-center placebo-controlled trial.,"AIMS:   Topiramate has shown efficacy at facilitating abstinence from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient trial tested topiramate for treating methamphetamine addiction.DESIGN:   Participants (n = 140) were randomized to receive topiramate or placebo (13 weeks) in escalating doses from 25 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] to the target maintenance of 200 mg/day in weeks 6-12 (tapered in week 13). Medication was combined with weekly brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment.SETTING:   The trial was conducted at eight medical centers in the United States.PARTICIPANTS:   One hundred and forty methamphetamine-dependent adults took part in the trial.MEASUREMENTS:   The primary outcome was abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6-12. Secondary outcomes included use reduction versus baseline, as well as psychosocial variables.FINDINGS:   In the intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate did not increase abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6-12. For secondary outcomes, topiramate reduced weekly median urine methamphetamine levels and observer-rated severity of dependence scores significantly. Subjects with negative urine before randomization (n = 26) had significantly greater abstinence on topiramate versus placebo during study weeks 6-12. Topiramate was safe and well tolerated.CONCLUSIONS:   Topiramate does not appear to promote abstinence in methamphetamine users but can reduce the amount taken and reduce relapse rates in those who are already abstinent.","National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.",2012,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03771.x

This study investigated the effects of this intervention program specifically on alcohol and marijuana use. Youth living with HIV (n = 143, mean age = 20.7, 51.5% male) were recruited from four sites in the United States, and randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions. The four-session intervention focused on two of three possible problem behaviors based on entry screening; this study focused on 143 HIV-positive youth who received the intervention for substance use. At 15-month follow-up past-week alcohol use was significantly lower for intervention youth than control youth (39.7% versus 53.6%, χ2 = 2.81, 0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.01); developmental trajectory analysis demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol use, but more importantly the intervention was effective over time in significantly reducing the adolescent's probability of being classified into the high-risk trajectory group.

The ASSIST screens for problem or risky use of 10 psychoactive substances, producing a score for each substance that falls into either a low-, moderate- or high-risk category.DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial in which participants were either assigned to a 3-month waiting-list control condition or received brief motivational counselling lasting an average of 13.8 minutes for the drug receiving the highest ASSIST score.SETTING: Primary health-care settings in four countries: Australia, Brazil, India and the United States.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 731 males and females scoring within the moderate-risk range of the ASSIST for cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants or opioids.MEASUREMENTS: ASSIST-specific substance involvement scores for cannabis, stimulants or opioids and ASSIST total illicit substance involvement score at baseline and 3 months post-randomization.FINDINGS: Omnibus analyses indicated that those receiving the BI had significantly reduced scores for all measures, compared with control participants. Country-specific analyses showed that, with the exception of the site in the United States, BI participants had significantly lower ASSIST total illicit substance involvement scores at follow-up compared with the control participants. The sites in India and Brazil demonstrated a very strong brief intervention effect for cannabis scores (P &lt; 0.005 for both sites), as did the sites in Australia (P &lt; 0.005) and Brazil (P &lt; 0.01) for stimulant scores and the Indian site for opioid scores (P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test-linked brief intervention aimed at reducing illicit substance use and related risks is effective, at least in the short term, and the effect generalizes across countries.","DASSA WHO Collaborating Centre for Research into the Treatment of Drug and Alcohol Problems, Department of Pharmacology, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia. rachel.humeniuk@adelaide.edu.au",2011,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03740.x
157,,22032097,Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder prevalence estimates in correctional systems: a systematic literature review.,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic search of the literature for studies that estimated the prevalence/incidence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in correctional systems in different countries and, based on these data, to estimate a) the number of people with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS)/FASD within the criminal justice system population, and b) the relative risk of becoming imprisoned for individuals with FAS/FASD compared with those without FAS/FASD.METHOD: A systematic world literature review of published and unpublished studies concerning the prevalence/incidence of FASD in correctional systems was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic databases.SYNTHESIS: Very little empirical evidence is available on the prevalence of FASD in correctional systems. There were no studies estimating the prevalence/incidence of FASD in correctional systems found for any country other than Canada and the USA. The few studies that have identified incarcerated individuals with FASD estimate that the number of undiagnosed persons in correctional facilities is high. Based on available Canadian data, this study estimates that youths with FASD are 19 times more likely to be incarcerated than youths without FASD in a given year.CONCLUSION: More studies investigating the prevalence/incidence of alcohol-affected people in the criminal justice system are required. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about the prevalence and disabilities of individuals with FASD in the criminal justice system and about appropriate responses. The criminal justice system is an ideal arena for intervention efforts aimed at the rehabilitation and prevention or reduction of recidivism in this unique population.","Social and Epidemiological Research Department, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON. lana_popova@camh.net",2011,NA

Participants were grouped as vegan, lacto ovo vegetarian, pesco vegetarian, semi-vegetarian or non-vegetarian (reference group). A follow-up questionnaire after two years elicited information on the development of diabetes. Cases of diabetes developed in 0.54% of vegans, 1.08% of lacto ovo vegetarians, 1.29% of pesco vegetarians, 0.92% of semi-vegetarians and 2.12% of non-vegetarians. Blacks had an increased risk compared to non-Blacks (odds ratio [OR] 1.364; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.093-1.702). In multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, education, income, television watching, physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, smoking and BMI, vegans (OR 0.381; 95% CI 0.236-0.617), lacto ovo vegetarians (OR 0.618; 95% CI 0.503-0.760) and semi-vegetarians (OR 0.486, 95% CI 0.312-0.755) had a lower risk of diabetes than non-vegetarians. In non-Blacks vegan, lacto ovo and semi-vegetarian diets were protective against diabetes (OR 0.429, 95% CI 0.249-0.740; OR 0.684, 95% CI 0.542-0.862; OR 0.501, 95% CI 0.303-0.827); among Blacks vegan and lacto ovo vegetarian diets were protective (OR 0.304, 95% CI 0.110-0.842; OR 0.472, 95% CI 0.270-0.825). These associations were strengthened when BMI was removed from the analyses.CONCLUSION: Vegetarian diets (vegan, lacto ovo, semi-) were associated with a substantial and independent reduction in diabetes incidence. In Blacks the dimension of the protection associated with vegetarian diets was as great as the excess risk associated with Black ethnicity.","Loma Linda University School of Public Health, Department of Health Promotion and Education, Loma Linda, CA 92354, USA. stonstad@llu.edu",2011,10.1016/j.numecd.2011.07.004
159,,21937285,Walking capacity of bariatric surgery candidates.,"BACKGROUND: This study characterizes the walking limitations of bariatric surgery candidates by age and body mass index (BMI) and determines factors independently associated with walking capacity. The setting was multi-institutional at research university hospitals in the United States.METHODS: Participants of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (n=2458; age 18-78 yr, BMI 33-94 kg/m(2)) attended a preoperative research visit. Their walking capacity was measured by self-report and the 400 m Long Distance Corridor Walk (LDCW).RESULTS: Almost two thirds (64%) of subjects reported limitations with walking several blocks, 48% had an objectively defined mobility deficit, and 16% reported at least some walking aid use. In multivariate analysis, BMI, older age, lower income, and greater bodily pain were independently associated (P &lt; .05) with walking aid use, physical discomfort during the LDCW, an inability to complete the LDCW, and a slower time to complete the LDCW. Female gender, Hispanic ethnicity (but not race), greater heart rate at rest, a history of smoking, several co-morbidities (history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, asthma, sleep apnea, venous edema with ulcerations), and depressive symptoms were also independently related (P &lt; .05) to at least one measure of reduced walking capacity.CONCLUSIONS: Walking limitations are common in bariatric surgery candidates, even among the least severely obese and youngest patients. Physical activity counseling must be tailored to individuals' abilities. Although several factors identified in the present study (eg, BMI, age, pain, co-morbidities) should be considered, directly assessing the patient's walking capacity will facilitate appropriate goal setting.","University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA. kingw@edc.pitt.edu",2011,10.1016/j.soard.2011.07.003
160,,21917054,Determining the relative importance of the mechanisms of behavior change within Alcoholics Anonymous: a multiple mediator analysis.,"AIMS: Evidence indicates that Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) participation reduces relapse risk but less is known about the mechanisms through which AA confers this benefit. Initial studies indicate self-efficacy, negative affect, adaptive social networks and spiritual practices are mediators of this effect, but because these have been tested in isolation, their relative importance remains elusive. This study tested multiple mediators simultaneously to help determine the most influential pathways.DESIGN: Prospective, statistically controlled, naturalistic investigation examined the extent to which these previously identified mechanisms mediated AA attendance effects on alcohol outcomes controlling for baseline outcome values, mediators, treatment, and other confounders.SETTING: Nine clinical sites within the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 1726) suffering from alcohol use disorder (AUD) initially enrolled in a randomized study with two arms: aftercare (n = 774); and out-patient (n = 952) comparing three out-patient treatments (Project MATCH).MEASUREMENTS: AA attendance during treatment; mediators at 9 months; and outcomes [percentage of days abstinent (PDA) and drinks per drinking day (DDD)] at 15 months.FINDINGS: Among out-patients the effect of AA attendance on alcohol outcomes was explained primarily by adaptive social network changes and increases in social abstinence self-efficacy. Among more impaired aftercare patients, in addition to mediation through adaptive network changes and increases in social self-efficacy, AA lead to better outcomes through increasing spirituality/religiosity and by reducing negative affect. The degree to which mediators explained the relationship between AA and outcomes ranged from 43% to 67%.CONCLUSION: While Alcoholics Anonymous facilitates recovery by mobilizing several processes simultaneously, it is changes in social factors which appear to be of primary importance.","Center for Addiction Medicine, Department of Psychiatry, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, 02114, USA. jkelly11@partners.org",2011,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03593.x

We studied a cohort of patients receiving LEC and antiemetic prophylaxis with palonosetron (Group 1) versus other 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists (5-HT(3)-RAs) (Group 2), to determine the overall rate of CINV and the proportion of patients experiencing delayed CINV (days 2-7 of a CT cycle) in a hospital outpatient setting.METHODS: Patients aged ≥18 years with cancer diagnosis initiating single-day and multi-day LEC for the first time between 4/1/2007 and 3/31/2009 were identified from the Premier Perspective database. CINV events (ICD-9-CM codes for nausea, vomiting, or volume depletion or CINV-related rescue medications) were assessed descriptively. A generalized linear multivariate regression model was developed, estimating the overall CINV event rate among Group 1 and 2 patients in the follow-up period (first of eight chemotherapy [CT] cycles or 6 months).RESULTS: In the follow-up period, out of a total of 10,137 overall CINV events (single-day and multi-day LEC), 8783 events (86.6%) were identified in single-day LEC treated patients. Within single-day LEC treated events, in the first cycle, of 3184 events, 2996 (94.1%) events were delayed. Average number of delayed events per patient remained consistent throughout the eight cycles (3.1 [1st cycle] vs. 2.9 [8th cycle]; P = 0.842]). Among 2439 patients on antiemetic prophylaxis with a 5-HT(3)-RA, 10.1% (n = 247) initiated palonosetron. Regression analysis indicated that Group 1 patients (versus Group 2) had a 15.2% reduction in CINV event rate per CT cycle; P = 0.0403. Study limitations include potential lack of generalizability, absence of data on certain confounders including alcohol consumption and prior history of motion sickness, potential underestimation of incidence of uncontrolled CINV, and inability to draw conclusions pertaining to cause and effect relationship.CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis, delayed CINV comprised a major proportion of overall CINV among cancer diagnosed patients on single-day LEC. Additionally, palonosetron prophylaxis was associated with a significantly lower overall CINV event rate versus other 5-HT(3)-RA prophylaxis in single- and multi-day LEC treatment.","Accelerated Community Oncology Research Network, Memphis, TN, USA.",2011,10.1185/03007995.2011.596201
163,,21689897,"Gender, race, and group behavior in group drug treatment.","BACKGROUND: Group drug counseling is the primary treatment modality used to treat drug dependence in community settings in the United States. Findings from the social psychology literature suggest that gender may influence how individuals participate in groups, and that race may moderate the effects of gender on group behavior. This study examined gender, race, and their interaction as predictors of alliance, participation, self-disclosure, and receipt of advice and feedback in drug counseling groups, and explored how gender and racial differences in drug counseling group behavior related to outcome of cocaine dependence treatment.METHOD: Ratings of group behavior were made from videotaped sessions of group drug counseling drawn from a randomized trial of treatment for cocaine-dependent individuals (n=438). Analyses examined the effects of race (African American or non-Hispanic White), gender, and the race by gender interaction on group behavior. Additional analyses examined race, gender, and group behavior, and interactions among these variables in predicting monthly cocaine use.RESULTS: Race and the race by gender interaction, but not gender alone, predicted many group behaviors. Non-Hispanic White women had the highest rates of self-disclosure and receipt of advice and non-positive feedback, followed by men of both races, with African American women having the lowest levels. These differences were unrelated to cross-sectional cocaine outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Women, but not men, of different races acted differently in mixed-race, mixed-gender cocaine treatment groups, with African American women exhibiting less of several behaviors. Additional research on causes and consequences of these differences could inform interventions for drug-dependent women.","Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Brown University, 700 Butler Drive, Providence, RI 02906, USA.

Previous trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the smoking-cessation medication varenicline have used largely participants of Caucasian origin.OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of varenicline in populations of participants from Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East to investigate potential differences in the therapeutic response to varenicline.METHODS: This multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 42 centers in 11 countries (Latin America: Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Venezuela; Africa: Egypt and South Africa; Middle East: Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). Participants were male and female smokers aged 18 to 75 years who were motivated to stop smoking; smoked ≥10 cigarettes/d, with no cumulative period of abstinence &gt;3 months in the previous year; and who had no serious or unstable disease within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive varenicline 1 mg or placebo, BID for 12 weeks, with a 12-week nontreatment follow-up. Brief smoking-cessation counseling was provided. The main outcome measures were carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate (CAR) at weeks 9 to 12 and weeks 9 to 24. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded for tolerability assessment.RESULTS: Overall, 588 subjects (varenicline, 390; placebo, 198) were randomized and treated. The mean (SD) ages of subjects in the varenicline and placebo groups were 43.1 (10.8) and 43.9 (10.8) years, respectively; 57.7% and 65.7% were male; and the mean (SD) weights were 75.0 (16.0) and 76.7 (16.3) kg (range, 40.0-130.0 and 45.6-126.0 kg). CAR at weeks 9 to 12 was significantly higher with varenicline than with placebo (53.59% vs 18.69%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.76; 95% CI, 3.74-8.88; P &lt; 0.0001), and this rate was maintained during weeks 9 to 24 (39.74% vs 13.13%; OR = 4.78; 95% CI, 2.97-7.68; P &lt; 0.0001).

The purpose of this study was to test the preliminary efficacy of a culturally adapted six-session gender-stratified group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use among HIV-infected out-patients in Eldoret, Kenya.DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial comparing CBT against a usual care assessment-only control.SETTING: A large HIV out-patient clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, part of the Academic Model for Providing Access to Healthcare collaboration.PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-five HIV-infected out-patients who were antiretroviral (ARV)-initiated or ARV-eligible and who reported hazardous or binge drinking.MEASUREMENTS: Percentage of drinking days (PDD) and mean drinks per drinking days (DDD) measured continuously using the Time line Follow back method.FINDINGS: There were 299 ineligible and 102 eligible out-patients with 12 refusals. Effect sizes of the change in alcohol use since baseline between the two conditions at the 30-day follow-up were large [d=0.95, P=0.0002, mean difference=24.93, 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.43, 37.43 PDD; d=0.76, P=0.002, mean difference=2.88, 95% CI: 1.05, 4.70 DDD]. Randomized participants attended 93% of the six CBT sessions offered. Reported alcohol abstinence at the 90-day follow-up was 69% (CBT) and 38% (usual care). Paraprofessional counselors achieved independent ratings of adherence and competence equivalent to college-educated therapists in the United States. Treatment effect sizes were comparable to alcohol intervention studies conducted in the United States.CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be adapted successfully to group paraprofessional delivery in Kenya and may be effective in reducing alcohol use among HIV-infected Kenyan out-patients.","Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, Providence, RI 02906,USA. rebecca_papas@brown.edu",2011,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03518.x
167,,21510783,A review of tobacco use treatments in U.S. ethnic minority populations.,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Among racial and ethnic minorities, disparities in tobacco use, knowledge of health risks and treatment resources, and access to and utilization of treatment contribute to a disproportionate disease burden from tobacco use. Furthermore, racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented within tobacco treatment studies.OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a review of published studies examining tobacco treatment interventions among ethnic and minority populations in the United States.METHODS: Literature searches were used to identify smoking cessation interventions involving racial/ethnic minority populations. Identified studies were published between 1985 and 2009 involving African-American, Latino, Native American, and Asian or Pacific Islander smokers. Studies included in the review (1) targeted one or more ethnic minority group or had at least 10% of study participants from ethnic minority groups and (2) reported abstinence outcomes.RESULTS: Sixty-four studies were included in this review. Of studies meeting inclusion criteria, 28 included a primary focus on African-Americans, 10 focused on Latinos, 4 focused on Native Americans, and 3 focused on Asian-American smokers. An additional 19 studies reported samples including participants from more than one minority group. Sample inclusion criteria, intervention content and duration, follow-up, abstinence assessment, and limitations of these studies were reviewed.CONCLUSIONS: Individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations are interested in stopping smoking and willing to participate in treatment research. Variations in the content of treatment intervention and study design produced a range of abstinence outcomes across studies. Additional research is needed for all groups, including African-American smokers, and special attention is warranted for Latino, Native American, and Asian groups given the paucity of published studies. Although there were limited evaluations of pharmacotherapy, the existing data support use of pharmacotherapy in addition to counseling for enhancing abstinence outcomes. Further attention to level of individual smoking, variability in smoking patterns, and use of other tobacco products is needed, given known variation within and between racial and ethnic groups. Overall, findings are consistent with recommendations from the 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines calling for increased research devoted to evaluating and enhancing tobacco use treatment interventions among racial and ethnic minority populations.","Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, Kansas 66160, USA.

Ovid Medline and CINAHL databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and 2008 relating to PCHB. Six major categories of factors were identified: frequency of alcohol intake prior and during pregnancy, glycemic control/diabetes management, physical activity before and during pregnancy, pregnancy planning behavior, cystic fibrosis carrier screening, and other risk factors. A critical finding of this review is that knowledge, awareness, and beliefs of preconception care do not lead to preconception health practice. Younger preconceptional women and women with children were less likely to engage in PCHB. However, women with advanced postgraduate education were more likely to practice preconception care. There is an urgent need to educate young preconceptional women regarding the importance and benefits of practicing preconception care.","Texas A&amp;M University Child &amp; Adolescent Health Research Lab, College Station, TX, USA. dieula.delissaint@gmail.com",2011,10.1177/1090198110389709

Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), or referral to local treatment sources (&quot;treatment as usual&quot; [TAU]). Addictive behavior, mood states, and general health were compared. Candor concerning alcohol use was encouraged by keeping drinking questionnaires in confidence, except in medical emergencies. Ninety-one subjects were studied; 46 received MET, 45 received TAU, 29 proceeded to transplantation (MET, n = 13; TAU, n = 16). A total of 69 subjects completed 24 weeks of observation, and 25 subjects were assessed at 96 weeks. No difference in study attendance was observed, but significantly more MET subjects attended 1 or more treatment sessions. Twenty-three subjects (25% of sample) drank after randomization but before transplant. Excluding an extreme outlier, MET drinkers had significantly fewer drinks per drinking days than TAU drinkers. Neither treatment plan resulted in significant variances in measures of psychosocial health. In conclusion, although MET afforded no significant benefit over TAU for mood or general health outcomes, this study provides some degree of support for MET to limit the quantity and frequency of pretransplant alcohol consumption among liver transplant candidates with alcohol dependence. However, because of the limited number of study subjects, these data must be interpreted cautiously. Further research to validate our findings or to identify better methods to identify and intervene with patients at risk of pretransplant and posttransplant drinking should continue.","Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. robert.weinrieb@uphs.upenn.edu",2011,10.1002/lt.22259
170,,21504559,The prevalence of waterpipe tobacco smoking among the general and specific populations: a systematic review.,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to systematically review the medical literature for the prevalence of waterpipe tobacco use among the general and specific populations.METHODS: We electronically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the ISI the Web of Science. We selected studies using a two-stage duplicate and independent screening process. We included cohort studies and cross sectional studies assessing the prevalence of use of waterpipe in either the general population or a specific population of interest. Two reviewers used a standardized and pilot tested form to collect data from each eligible study using a duplicate and independent screening process. We stratified the data analysis by country and by age group. The study was not restricted to a specific context.RESULTS: Of a total of 38 studies, only 4 were national surveys; the rest assessed specific populations. The highest prevalence of current waterpipe smoking was among school students across countries: the United States, especially among Arab Americans (12%-15%) the Arabic Gulf region (9%-16%), Estonia (21%), and Lebanon (25%). Similarly, the prevalence of current waterpipe smoking among university students was high in the Arabic Gulf region (6%), the United Kingdom (8%), the United States (10%), Syria (15%), Lebanon (28%), and Pakistan (33%). The prevalence of current waterpipe smoking among adults was the following: Pakistan (6%), Arabic Gulf region (4%-12%), Australia (11% in Arab speaking adults), Syria (9%-12%), and Lebanon (15%). Group waterpipe smoking was high in Lebanon (5%), and Egypt (11%-15%). In Lebanon, 5%-6% pregnant women reported smoking waterpipe during pregnancy. The studies were all cross-sectional and varied by how they reported waterpipe smoking.CONCLUSION: While very few national surveys have been conducted, the prevalence of waterpipe smoking appears to be alarmingly high among school students and university students in Middle Eastern countries and among groups of Middle Eastern descent in Western countries.","Department of Medicine, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY, USA. elieakl@buffalo.edu",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-244
171,,21464363,"Rewarding, stimulant, and sedative alcohol responses and relationship to future binge drinking.","CONTEXT: Excessive consumption of alcohol is a major problem in the United States and abroad. Despite many years of study, it is unclear why some individuals drink alcohol excessively while others do not. It has been postulated that either lower or greater acute responses to alcohol, or both, depending on the limb of the breath alcohol concentration curve, contribute to propensity for alcohol misuse.OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the relationship of acute alcohol responses to future binge drinking.DESIGN: Within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multidose laboratory alcohol challenge study with intensive follow-up. Each participant completed 3 randomized sessions examining responses to a high (0.8 g/kg) and low (0.4 g/kg) alcohol dose and placebo, followed by quarterly assessments for 2 years examining drinking behaviors and alcohol diagnoses.SETTING: Participants recruited from the community.PARTICIPANTS: High-risk heavy social drinkers aged 21 to 35 years who habitually engage in weekly binge drinking (n = 104) and light drinker controls (n = 86).INTERVENTION: We conducted 570 laboratory sessions with a subsequent 99.1% follow-up (1506 of 1520).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale, Drug Effects Questionnaire, cortisol response, Timeline Follow-Back, Drinker Inventory of Consequences-Recent, and DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence.RESULTS: Alcohol produced greater stimulant and rewarding (liking and wanting) responses and lower sedative and cortisol responses in heavy vs light drinkers. Among the heavy drinkers, greater positive effects and lower sedative effects after alcohol consumption predicted increased binge drinking frequency during follow-up. In turn, greater frequency of binge drinking during follow-up was associated with greater likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence.CONCLUSIONS: The widely held low level response theory and differentiator model should be revised: in high-risk drinkers, stimulant and rewarding alcohol responses even at peak breath alcohol concentrations are important predictors of future alcohol problems.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00961792.","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. aking@bsd.uchicago.edu",2011,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.26

The disparity in HIV infection rate among African Americans youth residing in rural Southern regions of the United States suggests that there is an urgent need to identify ways to promote early preventive intervention to reduce HIV-related risk behavior. The Strong African American Families (SAAF) program, a preventive intervention for rural African American parents and their 11-year-olds, was specially designed to deter early sexual onset and the initiation and escalation of alcohol and drug use among rural African American preadolescents. A clustered-randomized prevention trial was conducted, contrasting families who took part in SAAF with control families. The trial, which included 332 families, indicated that intervention-induced changes occurred in intervention-targeted parenting, which in turn facilitated changes in youths' internal protective processes and positive sexual norms. Long-term follow up assessments when youth were 17 years old revealed that intervention-induced changes in parenting practices mediated the effect of intervention-group influences on changes in the onset and escalation of risky sexual behaviors over 65 months through its positive influence on adolescents' self-pride and their sexual norms. The findings underscore the powerful effects of parenting practices among rural African American families that over time serve a protective role in reducing youth's risk behavior, including HIV vulnerable behaviors.","Peabody College, Vanderbilt University, #90 230 Appleton Place, Nashville, TN 37203-5721, USA. velma.m.murry@vanderbilt.edu",2011,10.1007/s10964-011-9642-x
173,,21353516,Maintenance pharmacotherapy of mild and moderate COPD: what is the evidence?,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects more than 24 million individuals in the United States, although at least half of the cases are not diagnosed. Proactive diagnosis and limitation of risk exposure from smoking or pollutants are important to improve prognosis. Pharmacologic treatments are prescribed according to COPD stage and symptoms. Mild COPD is symptomatically treated 'as needed' with short-acting bronchodilators; major guidelines recommend starting maintenance treatment at the moderate COPD stage with long-acting bronchodilators; inhaled corticosteroids may be added for patients with more severe disease and frequent exacerbations. Maintenance therapy preserves 24-h airway patency, reduces exacerbations, and improves activity tolerance and health-related quality of life. Recent post-hoc analyses of large clinical trials that contain subgroups of patients with less severe COPD suggest that, similar to those with advanced disease, patients with moderate disease benefit from long-term maintenance therapies. Studies suggest symptomatic mild patients may also benefit. This concept needs to be prospectively tested in studies specific to these COPD disease stages. Proactive identification and pharmacologic intervention in early COPD has the potential to alter clinical outcomes throughout the disease course.","Pulmonary Research Institute of Southeast Michigan, 28815 Eight Mile Road, Suite 103, Livonia, MI 48152, USA. garytferguson@msn.com",2011,10.1016/j.rmed.2011.02.005

Methamphetamine use in pregnancy endangers the health of the woman and increases the risk of low birth weight and small for gestational age babies and such use may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental problems in children. All pregnant women should be asked about their drug and alcohol use. Urine toxicology screening may be useful in detecting methamphetamine and other substance abuse during pregnancy, but this screening should only be done with maternal consent after counseling regarding the potential ramifications of a positive test result.

175,,21338506,Evaluating a selective prevention programme for binge drinking among young adolescents: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: In comparison to other Europe countries, Dutch adolescents are at the top in drinking frequency and binge drinking. A total of 75% of the Dutch 12 to 16 year olds who drink alcohol also engage in binge drinking. A prevention programme called Preventure was developed in Canada to prevent adolescents from binge drinking. This article describes a study that aims to assess the effects of this selective school-based prevention programme in The Netherlands.METHODS: A randomized controlled trial is being conducted among 13 to 15-year-old adolescents in secondary schools. Schools were randomly assigned to the intervention and control conditions. The intervention condition consisted of two 90 minute group sessions, carried out at the participants' schools and provided by a qualified counsellor and a co-facilitator. The intervention targeted young adolescents who demonstrated personality risk for alcohol abuse. The group sessions were adapted to four personality profiles. The control condition received no further intervention above the standard substance use education sessions provided in the Dutch national curriculum. The primary outcomes will be the percentage reduction in binge drinking, weekly drinking and drinking-related problems after three specified time periods. A screening survey collected data by means of an Internet questionnaire. Students have completed, or will complete, a post-treatment survey after 2, 6, and 12 months, also by means of an online questionnaire.DISCUSSION: This study protocol presents the design and current implementation of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a selective alcohol prevention programme. We expect that a significantly lower number of adolescents will binge drink, drink weekly, and have drinking-related problems in the intervention condition compared to the control condition, as a result of this intervention.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in the Dutch Trial Register (Cochrane Collaboration) as NTR1920.","Trimbos Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands. jlammers@trimbos.nl",2011,10.1186/1471-2458-11-126

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a healthy lifestyle index on the risk of breast cancer.METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Mexico from 2004 to 2007. One thousand incident cases and 1,074 controls, matched to cases by 5-year age category, region, and health institution, participated in the study. A healthy lifestyle index was developed by means of principal components by using dietary pattern, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A conditional logistic regression model was used to assess this association.RESULTS: The healthy lifestyle index was defined as the combined effect of moderate and/or vigorous-intensity physical activity, low consumption of fat, processed foods, refined cereals, complex sugars, and the avoidance of tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. Results showed a protective effect on both pre- (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84) and postmenopausal women (OR = O.20, 95% CI: 0.11-0.37) when highest versus lowest index quintiles were compared.CONCLUSIONS: Healthy lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the odds of having breast cancer. Primary prevention of this disease should be promoted in an integrated manner. Effective strategies need to be identified to engage women in healthy lifestyles.IMPACT: This study is the first to assess a healthy lifestyle index in relation to the risk of breast cancer.","Centro de Investigación en Salud Poblacional, Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.",2011,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-1036

A priori hypotheses were that Internet enhanced with tailored content and social support would outperform basic Internet (BI) and that enhanced Internet (EI) plus proactive telephone counseling would outperform the other conditions.METHODS: The Quit Using Internet and Telephone Treatment (iQUITT) study used a 3-group randomized controlled design comparing BI, EI, and EI and telephone combined (EI+P). The trial was conducted from March 8, 2005, through November 30, 2008. Current adult smokers in the United States who smoked 5 or more cigarettes per day were recruited via search engines. Characteristics of the 2005 participants include mean (SD) age of 35.9 (10.8) years, 51.1% women, and 86.5% white. The follow-up assessment rate at 18 months was 68.2%. The main outcome measure was 30-day point prevalence abstinence measured at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months after randomization using intent-to-treat analysis.RESULTS: At 18 months, the 30-day multiple point prevalence abstinence rate across all follow-up intervals was 3.5% (BI), 4.5% (EI), and 7.7% (EI+P), with EI+P significantly outperforming BI and EI. At 18 months, 30-day single point prevalence abstinence rates were 19.0% (BI), 17.4% (EI), and 19.6% (EI+P) and did not differ among the groups.CONCLUSIONS: Combined Internet and telephone treatment outperforms static and dynamic Internet interventions.TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00282009.","Schroeder Institute for Tobacco Research and Policy Studies, American Legacy Foundation, Washington, DC 20036, USA. agraham@americanlegacy.org",2011,10.1001/archinternmed.2010.451

This article presents data from the College Health Intervention Projects on the frequency of depression and suicide ideation among 1,622 college students who accessed primary care services in 4 university clinics in the Midwest, Northwest, and Canada. Students completed the Beck Depression Inventory and other measures related to exercise patterns, alcohol use, sensation seeking, and violence. The frequency of depression was similar for men (25%) and women (26%). Thought of suicide was higher for men (13%) than women (10%). Tobacco use, emotional abuse, and unwanted sexual encounters were all associated with screening positive for depression. &quot;Days of exercise per week&quot; was inversely associated with screening positive for depression. Because the majority of students access campus-based student health centers, medical providers can serve a key role in early identification and intervention. With every 4th student reporting symptoms of depression and every 10th student having suicidal thoughts, such interventions are needed.","University of Washington, USA.",2011,10.1111/j.1939-0025.2010.01077.x

Results were restricted to literature published in the last five years with the following research designs: systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. There were no language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2010. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment (HTA) and HTA-related agencies, national and international medical specialty societies, clinical practice guideline collections, and clinical trial registries. Each article was screened for relevance and the full text acquired if determined to be relevant. The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the members of the Expert Workgroup established by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. The quality of evidence was evaluated and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.VALUES: the quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1).SPONSOR: the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.ENDORSEMENT: these consensus guidelines have been endorsed by the Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Quebec; the Canadian Association of Midwives; the Canadian Association of Perinatal, Women's Health and Neonatal Nurses (CAPWHN); the College of Family Physicians of Canada; the Federation of Medical Women of Canada; the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada; and Motherisk. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. There is evidence that alcohol consumption in pregnancy can cause fetal harm. (II-2) There is insufficient evidence regarding fetal safety or harm at low levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy. (III) 2. There is insufficient evidence to define any threshold for low-level drinking in pregnancy. (III) 3. Abstinence is the prudent choice for a woman who is or might become pregnant. (III) 4. Intensive culture-, gender-, and family-appropriate interventions need to be available and accessible for women with problematic drinking and/or alcohol dependence. (II-2).RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Universal screening for alcohol consumption should be done periodically for all pregnant women and women of child-bearing age. Ideally, at-risk drinking could be identified before pregnancy, allowing for change. (II-2B) 2. Health care providers should create a safe environment for women to report alcohol consumption. (III-A) 3. The public should be informed that alcohol screening and support for women at risk is part of routine women's health care. (III-A) 4. Health care providers should be aware of the risk factors associated with alcohol use in women of reproductive age. (III-B) 5. Brief interventions are effective and should be provided by health care providers for women with at-risk drinking. (II-2B) 6. If a woman continues to use alcohol during pregnancy, harm reduction/treatment strategies should be encouraged. (II-2B) 7. Pregnant women should be given priority access to withdrawal management and treatment. (III-A) 8. Health care providers should advise women that low-level consumption of alcohol in early pregnancy is not an indication for termination of pregnancy. (II-2A).",NA,2010,NA

Squamous cell carcinomas of the lips and cancers of the oropharynx (including the posterior one-third of the base of the tongue and the tonsils were excluded.METHODOLOGY: A specially convened expert panel evaluated the available evidence which was derived from a systematic search of Medline and the Cochrane Library. Further details about the search are available in a supplement to the published article available on the Journal of the America Dental Association's website (http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/141/5/509). Qualitative synthesis of the data was performed by the panel. Where consensus could not be reached majority voting was employed. Recommendations were reviewed by internal and external scientific experts and organisations. After review recommendations were revised where appropriate and the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs approved the final clinical recommendations.REVIEW AND UPDATING: No information provided in article.RECOMMENDATIONS: The key recommendations were all classified as level D being based on grade IV evidence or extrapolated from grade I, II or III evidence using a system based on Shekelle et al.(1) The main recommendations can be summarised as:1) Clinicians should remain alert for signs of potentially malignant lesions or early-stage cancers in all patients while performing routine visual and tactile examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or who are heavy consumers of alcohol. 2) For seemingly innocuous lesions, clinicians should follow up in seven to 14 days to confirm persistence after removing any possible cause to reduce the potential for false-positive screening results. 3) For lesions that raise suspicion of cancer or for lesions that persist after removal of a possible cause, clinicians should communicate the potential benefits and risks of early diagnosis. Considerations include the following: a) that even suspicious lesions identified during the course of a routine visual and tactile examination may represent false positives; b) that clinical confirmation (a second opinion) can be sought from a dental or medical care provider with advanced training and experience in diagnosis of oral mucosal disease so as to reduce the potential for a false positive or false negative oral cancer screening result; c) that a malignancy or non-malignancy can be confirmed only via microscopic examination that requires a surgical biopsy; d) that a decision to pursue a biopsy to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy should be made in the context of informed consent. 4) Although transepithelial cytology has validity in identifying disaggregated dysplastic cells, the panel suggests surgical biopsy for definitive diagnosis.RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS: In all, 15 separate research recommendations were made ranging from determining the prevalence of potentially malignant oral mucosal lesions in the United States to whether the use of adjunctive devices improves patient education and adherence to follow-up care.","Centre for Evidence-based Dentistry, Oxford, UK.",2010,10.1038/sj.ebd.6400750

This paper examines the short-term outcomes of smokers randomized to one of two models of a pharmacist-led smoking cessation intervention.METHODS: An open-label pragmatic randomized trial compared two models of a pharmacist-led behavioral intervention [Group A (3-sessions) vs. Group B (1-session)] in conjunction with 5 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Ninety-eight pharmacies in Ontario, Canada delivered the intervention. Baseline demographic and smoking behavior data were recorded, as were intervention characteristics. Self-reported, 7-day point prevalence quit rates were obtained 5-week postintervention start date.RESULTS: 6,987 individuals participated; 51.4% (n = 3588) randomized to Group A; 48.6% (n = 3399) to Group B. Approximately, 50% of Group A participants completed all three sessions. Quit rates were significantly higher among Group A, 3-session completers (27.7%; n = 478) compared to Group B participants (18.0%; n = 604). Multivariable results suggest that even when controlling for possible confounders and clustering across pharmacies, Group A participants who completed all three sessions were more likely to quit compared to Group B [OR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.53, 1.94)].CONCLUSIONS: Cessation outcomes are higher among participants completing three intervention sessions compared to one session; however, many do not return for follow-up sessions.","Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada.",2010,10.1007/s10552-010-9672-9
182,,21138714,Impact of providing drinkers with &quot;know your limit&quot; information on drinking and driving: a field experiment.,"OBJECTIVE: Given that most effective alcohol harm-reduction laws specify the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that constitutes illegal behavior (e.g., the .08% breath alcohol concentration legal limit), interventions that allow drinkers to accurately estimate their BACs, and thus better assess their risk, have potential importance to long-term driving-under-the-influence prevention efforts. This study describes a field experiment designed to test the impact on drinking of providing &quot;Know Your Limit&quot; (KYL) BAC estimation cards to individuals in a natural drinking environment.METHOD: We randomly sampled 1,215 U.S. residents as they entered Mexico for a night of drinking, interviewed them, and randomly assigned them to one of six experimental conditions. Participants were reinterviewed and breath-tested when they returned to the United States. The experimental conditions included providing generic warnings about drinking and driving, giving out gender-specific BAC calculator cards (KYL cards), and providing incentives to moderate their drinking.RESULTS: Cueing participants about the risks of drunk driving resulted in significantly lower BACs (relative to control) for participants who indicated that they would drive home. Providing KYL matrixes did not reduce BACs, and, in fact, some evidence suggests that KYL cards undermined the effect of the warning.CONCLUSIONS: KYL information does not appear to be an effective tool for reducing drinking and driving. Implications for prevention and future research are discussed.","Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 11720 Beltsville Drive, Suite 900, Calverton, Maryland 20705,USA. mjohnson@pire.org.",2010,NA

Two hundred thirty-seven current smokers were randomly assigned to high-intensity intervention (HII; 30-min motivational interview plus seven routine telephone calls after hospital discharge) or to low-intensity intervention (LII; 15-min counseling about the benefits of quitting) and 80 comprised the usual care (UC) group. Six months after hospital discharge, all participants were contacted by phone. The main outcome measure was smoking cessation.RESULTS: The smoking-cessation rates were 44.9%, 41.7% and 26.3% for the HII, LII and UC groups, respectively (P = .03). The multivariable analysis identified the following variables which are associated with the failure to stop smoking: the absence of a tobacco-related disease (TRD), younger age and a low motivation for cessation at the initial contact.CONCLUSIONS: There was a great difference between intervention and nonintervention. The LII had an impact similar to the HII. The variables associated with no smoking cessation demonstrate the need for more personalized interventions for smokers who present lower indexes of motivation, are younger and do not have smoking-related diseases.","FCM UNICAMP, 13083-887 Campinas, SP, Brazil. azevedo.renata@uol.com.br",2010,10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.09.013

This study investigated (i) whether such interventions reduced drinking beyond the sanction alone, (ii) whether a brief motivational intervention (BMI) was more efficacious than two computer-delivered interventions (CDIs) and (iii) whether intervention response differed by gender.DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with four conditions [brief motivation interventions (BMI), Alcohol 101 Plus™, Alcohol Edu for Sanctions(®), delayed control] and four assessments (baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months).SETTING: Private residential university in the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Students (n = 677; 64% male) who had violated campus alcohol policies and were sanctioned to participate in a risk reduction program.MEASUREMENTS: Consumption (drinks per heaviest and typical week, heavy drinking frequency, peak and typical blood alcohol concentration), alcohol problems and recidivism.FINDINGS: Piecewise latent growth models characterized short-term (1-month) and longer-term (1-12 months) change. Female but not male students reduced drinking and problems in the control condition. Males reduced drinking and problems after all interventions relative to control, but did not maintain these gains. Females reduced drinking to a greater extent after a BMI than after either CDI, and maintained reductions relative to baseline across the follow-up year. No differences in recidivism were found.CONCLUSIONS: Male and female students responded differently to sanctions for alcohol violations and to risk reduction interventions. BMIs optimized outcomes for both genders. Male students improved after all interventions, but female students improved less after CDIs than after BMI.

This study evaluated an electronic alcohol-counseling clinical reminder at a single Veterans Affairs general medicine clinic.METHOD: The systems-level intervention evaluated in this study consisted of making the clinical reminder, which facilitated medical record documentation of brief intervention among patients who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use, available to providers on one (of two) randomly selected hallways. Secondary electronic data were extracted for all patients who visited the clinic (October 1, 2002, to September 30, 2005). The proportion of patients with clinical-reminder use was evaluated among patients who screened positive for unhealthy drinking and were assigned to intervention hallway providers (&quot;descriptive cohort&quot;). Adjusted logistic regression evaluated the association between the intervention and resolution of unhealthy drinking at follow-up among all screen-positive patients who completed a second Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test Consumption questionnaire 18 months or longer after the first (&quot;outcomes cohort&quot;).RESULTS: Eligible patients (N= 22,863) included 10,392 controls and 12,471 in the intervention group. Fifteen percent (398 of 2,640) of descriptive cohort patients with unhealthy drinking had clinical-reminder use, which varied by severity (14% [n = 302 of 2,165] with mild/moderate and 20% [n = 96 of 475] with severe unhealthy drinking,p = .001). Only 39% (156 of 398) of patients with clinical-reminder use had documented brief intervention; advice to abstain was most common. Access to the clinical reminder was not significantly associated with resolution of unhealthy drinking in 1,358 patients in the outcomes cohort.CONCLUSIONS: Availability of a clinical reminder to facilitate brief intervention did not, alone, result in substantial use of the clinical reminder.

187,,20708560,Adolescent gambling: a review of an emerging field of research.,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to summarize the research on adolescent gambling with implications for research and prevention or intervention.METHOD: The methodology involved a comprehensive and systematic search of &quot;adolescent or youth gambling&quot; in three diverse electronic databases (MedlineAdvanced, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts) and three peer-reviewed journals (International Journal of Gambling Studies, International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, and Journal of Gambling Issues).RESULTS: The search resulted in 137 articles (1985-2010) focusing on gambling among youth aged between 9 and 21 years: 103 quantitative, 8 qualitative, and 26 non-empirical. The study of adolescent gambling can be summarized as follows: (a) it is conducted by a relatively small group of researchers in Britain, Canada, and the United States; (b) it is primarily prevalence-focused, quantitative, descriptive, school-based, and atheoretical; (c) it has most often been published in the Journal of Gambling Studies; (d) it is most often examined in relation to alcohol use; (e) it has relatively few valid and reliable screening instruments that are developmentally appropriate for adolescents, and (f) it lacks racially diverse samples.CONCLUSION: Four recommendations are presented for both research and prevention or intervention which are as follows: (1) to provide greater attention to the development and validation of survey instruments or diagnostic criteria to assess adolescent problem gambling; (2) to begin to develop and test more gambling prevention or intervention strategies; (3) to not only examine the co-morbidity of gambling and alcohol abuse, but also include other behaviors such as sexual activity; and (4) to pay greater attention to racial and ethnic differences in the study of adolescent gambling.","Department of Sociology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA. pikel@iupui.edu",2010,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.05.003
188,,20670329,"A brief motivational interview in a pediatric emergency department, plus 10-day telephone follow-up, increases attempts to quit drinking among youth and young adults who screen positive for problematic drinking.","OBJECTIVES: Adolescents in their late teens and early 20s have the highest alcohol consumption in the United States; binge drinking peaks at age 21-25 years. Underage drinking is associated with many negative consequences, including academic problems and risk of intentional and unintentional injuries. This study tested the effectiveness of pediatric emergency department (PED) screening and brief intervention to reduce alcohol consumption and associated risks.METHODS: A three-group randomized assignment trial was structured to test differences between intervention (I) and standard assessed control (AC) groups in alcohol consumption and alcohol-related behaviors from baseline to 12 months and to compare the AC group with a minimally assessed control (MAC) group to adjust for the effect of assessment reactivity on control group behavior. Patients aged 14-21 years were eligible if they screened positive on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or for binge drinking or high-risk behaviors. The MAC group received a resource handout, written advice about alcohol-related risks, and a 12-month follow-up appointment. Patients in the AC group were assessed using standardized instruments in addition to the MAC protocol. The I group received a peer-conducted motivational intervention, referral to community resources and treatment if indicated, and a 10-day booster in addition to assessment. Measurements included 30-day self-report of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related behaviors, screens for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, and self-report of attempts to quit, cut back, or change conditions of use, all repeated at follow-up. Motor vehicle records and medical records were also analyzed for changes from baseline to 1-year follow-up.RESULTS: Among 7,807 PED patients screened, 1,202 were eligible; 853 enrolled (I, n = 283; AC, n = 284; MAC, n = 286), with a 12-month follow-up rate of 72%. At 12 months, more than half of enrollees in Reaching Adolescents for Prevention (RAP) attempted to cut back on drinking, and over a third tried to quit. A significantly larger proportion of the I group made efforts to quit drinking and to be careful about situations when drinking compared to AC enrollees, and there was a numerically but not significantly greater likelihood (p = 0.065) among the I group for efforts to cut back on drinking. At 3 months, the likelihood of the I group making attempts to cut back was almost triple that of ACs. For efforts to quit, it was double, and for trying to be careful about situations when drinking, there was a 72% increase in the odds ratio (OR) for the I group. Three-month results for attempts were sustained at 12 months for quit attempts and efforts to be careful. Consumption declined in both groups from baseline to 3 months to 12 months, but there were no significant between-group differences in alcohol-related consequences at 12 months or in alcohol-related risk behaviors. We found a pattern suggestive of assessment reactivity in only one variable at 12 months: the attempt to cut back (73.3% for the I group vs. 64.9% among the AC group and 54.8% among the MAC group).CONCLUSIONS: Brief motivational intervention resulted in significant efforts to change behavior (quit drinking and be careful about situations while drinking) but did not alter between-group consumption or consequences.","Youth Alcohol Prevention Center and the Department of Community Health Sciences, Boston University School of Public Health, Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.",2010,10.1111/j.1553-2712.2010.00818.x
189,,20662805,"Efficacy and safety of baclofen for alcohol dependence: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.","BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials and case-reports indicate that baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, may have efficacy for alcohol dependence. Baclofen has been shown to enhance abstinence, to reduce drinking quantity, to reduce craving, and to reduce anxiety in alcohol-dependent individuals in 2 placebo-controlled trials in Italy. However, the clinical trial data with baclofen is limited. The purpose of the present study was to test the efficacy and tolerability of baclofen in alcohol dependence in the United States.METHODS: The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study comparing 30 mg/d of baclofen to placebo over 12 weeks of treatment and utilizing 8 sessions of BRENDA, a low-intensity psychosocial intervention. One hundred and twenty-one subjects were screened to yield 80 randomized subjects (44 men) with randomization balanced for gender. Percent heavy drinking days was the primary outcome measure with other drinking outcomes, anxiety levels, and craving as secondary outcomes. Tolerability was examined.RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of subjects completed the study. No difference by drug condition was seen in percentage of heavy drinking days where on-average rates were 25.5% (±23.6%) for placebo and 25.9% (±23.2%) for baclofen during treatment (t(73)=0.59, p=0.56). Similarly, no differences were seen by drug condition in percentage of days abstinent, time to first drink, or time to relapse to heavy drinking. Baclofen was associated with a significant reduction in state anxiety (F(1,73)= 5.39, p=0.02). Baclofen was well tolerated with only 2 individuals stopping baclofen because of adverse events. There were no serious adverse events.CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, represents a possible new pharmacotherapeutic approach to alcohol dependence. Despite encouraging preclinical data and prior positive clinical trials with baclofen in Italy, the current trial did not find evidence that baclofen is superior to placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Additional clinical trial work is necessary to establish whether baclofen does or does not have therapeutic efficacy in alcohol dependence and, if it does, what factors are predictive of response.","Department of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB#7160, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7160, USA. jc_garbutt@med.unc.edu",2010,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01273.x
190,,20583679,Health status and health maintenance practices among doctors and nurses at two hospitals in Jamaica.,"The health of doctors and nurses is of paramount importance because they must be well to perform their jobs optimally under difficult conditions. However, the challenge of their working environment and the culture of their professions often lead to physical and mental illnesses. Despite this, there are several barriers to doctors and nurses seeking healthcare. In this study, the health status and health maintenance practices of doctors and nurses at two hospitals in Kingston, Jamaica, were assessed. This population was previously reported to have a 27% prevalence of probable mental distress based on the General Health Questionnaire 30 (GHQ30). Two hundred and twelve doctors and nurses were recruited into the study. The reported prevalence of chronic diseases was determined while mental health status was based on the GHQ30, reported signs and symptoms of stress and job satisfaction. Health maintenance practices studied included, health-seeking behaviour willingness to seek counselling, reported source of emotional support and use of alcohol and tobacco as coping strategies. Although, less than 50% of study participants reported that they were satisfied with their job, the mean number of days missed from work in the &quot;last six months&quot; was less than two and a half days. The mean time for &quot;last doctor's visit&quot; for nurses and doctors in the current study were 0.93 and 2.4 years, respectively. Females were more willing to seek medical attention than males. More than 50% reported signs and symptoms of stress and major sources of emotional support were friends (55.7%), followed by spouses (36.0%) and colleagues (12.3%). The prevalence of chronic diseases was less than 1% and alcohol and tobacco did not appear to be major coping strategies. The population appeared to be physically healthy and despite the known prevalence of probable mental distress, doctors and nurses appeared unwilling to seek healthcare. Probable barriers to seeking healthcare included confidentiality issues and the need to appear healthy to colleagues, patients and the community.","Department of Community Health and Psychiatry, The University of the West Indies, Kingston 7, Jamaica, West Indies. jaslindo@hotmail.com",2010,NA
191,,20569667,National survey of pediatricians' opinions about and practices for acute otitis media and xylitol use.,"BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the main reason for physician visits and antibiotic prescriptions in children. Pediatricians (Peds) are gatekeepers for services and sources of information for families. The 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians (AAP/AAFP) Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media recommended preventative and management measures for Peds' practice. Treatments for AOM (antimicrobial therapy and surgery) sometimes have questionable effectiveness, risks, and high costs. Thus, Peds should consider using prophylactics for AOM that are easy to administer, cost-effective, and have minimal side effects. Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, is widely used to prevent AOM and for other health conditions in Europe, and as a dental caries prophylaxis in the United States. It would be helpful to know Peds' attitudes and practices to identify barriers to xylitol's use as a prophylaxis for AOM in the United States.PURPOSE: To conduct a national survey of Peds in the United States to evaluate how closely they adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline, and their knowledge and opinions about xylitol use.RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized, national postal survey.METHOD: A 48-item questionnaire developed for this study was mailed to a random sample of 506 Peds within the United States during spring 2009. It assessed Peds' demographics, adherence to the guideline, and knowledge and opinions about and use of xylitol as a prophylaxis for AOM in children.RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 22% (98 useable/506 mailed - 63 returned undeliverable). Participants were about equal for gender, and almost all were in private practice for over 10 yr. Most had pediatric patients with at least one bout of AOM annually. The majority adhered to the guideline (e.g., almost all routinely assessed and managed patients' pain for AOM and encouraged prevention by recommending that families reduce risk factors). Most used and were comfortable with otoscopy for diagnosing AOM, but not tympanometry. Almost all believed that conductive hearing loss could hinder speech-language and academic development, and AOM could reduce quality of life of children. They also believed that those under 6 mo of age with AOM should receive antibacterial therapy beginning with amoxicillin but did not use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Only about half knew about medical uses for xylitol, but of those, most were aware of its use in chewing gum to prevent AOM but had not used it with patients. They were not sure of xylitol's effectiveness or appropriate dosages but cited stomach cramping and diarrhea as possible side effects. Most would use xylitol if evidence supported it and wanted information about it via reprints or electronically. Few agreed that audiologists are important in diagnosing/managing AOM.CONCLUSIONS: Most of these Peds adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline. They were not using CAMs like xylitol for preventing AOM in children. Future research should focus on prevention and the use of xylitol as a possible prophylaxis regimen for AOM in patients.","Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of California Santa Barbara, Goleta, CA 93117, USA. danhauer@speech.ucsb.edu",2010,10.3766/jaaa.21.5.5
192,,20530011,Prevalence of mental health problems and functional impairment among active component and National Guard soldiers 3 and 12 months following combat in Iraq.,"CONTEXT: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the association of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan with postdeployment mental health problems, particularly posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, studies have shown varying prevalence rates of these disorders based on different case definitions and have not assessed functional impairment, alcohol misuse, or aggressive behavior as comorbid factors occurring with PTSD and depression.OBJECTIVES: To (1) examine the prevalence rates of depression and PTSD using several case definitions including functional impairment, (2) determine the comorbidity of alcohol misuse or aggressive behaviors with depression or PTSD, and (3) compare rates between Active Component and National Guard soldiers at the 3- and 12-month time points following their deployment to Iraq.DESIGN: Population-based, cross-sectional study.SETTING: United States Army posts and National Guard armories.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 18 305 US Army soldiers from 4 Active Component and 2 National Guard infantry brigade combat teams.INTERVENTIONS: Between 2004 and 2007, anonymous mental health surveys were collected at 3 and 12 months following deployment.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Current PTSD, depression, functional impairment, alcohol misuse, and aggressive behavior.RESULTS: Prevalence rates for PTSD or depression with serious functional impairment ranged between 8.5% and 14.0%, with some impairment between 23.2% and 31.1%. Alcohol misuse or aggressive behavior comorbidity was present in approximately half of the cases. Rates remained stable for the Active Component soldiers but increased across all case definitions from the 3- to 12-month time point for National Guard soldiers.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of PTSD and depression after returning from combat ranged from 9% to 31% depending on the level of functional impairment reported. The high comorbidity with alcohol misuse and aggression highlights the need for comprehensive postdeployment screening. Persistent or increased prevalence rates at 12 months compared with 3 months postdeployment illustrate the persistent effects of war zone service and provide important data to guide postdeployment care.","Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Department of Military Psychiatry, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD 20910, USA. jeffrey.l.thomas@us.army.mil",2010,10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.54
193,,20528820,Binge drinking and suboptimal self-rated health among adult drinkers.,"BACKGROUND: Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the 79,000 annual deaths in the United States that are owing to excessive drinking. The overall objective of our study was to examine the prevalence of binge drinking and consumption levels associated with suboptimal self-rated health among the general population of adult drinkers in all 50 states and territories in the United States.METHODS: The study included a total of 200,587 current drinkers who participated in the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. We estimated the prevalence of binge drinking (i.e., &gt; or =5 drinks on 1 occasion for men or &gt; or =4 drinks on 1 occasion for women) and heavy drinking (i.e., an average of &gt;14 drinks per week for men or &gt;7 drinks per week for women), as well as the average number of binge episodes per person during a 30-day period. Odds ratios were produced with multivariate logistic regression models using binge-drinking levels as a predictor; status of suboptimal self-rated health was used as an outcome variable while controlling for sociodemographic, health, and behavioral risk factors.RESULTS: We estimate that 34.7 million adult drinkers in the United States engaged in binge drinking in 2008, including an estimated 42.2% who reported either heavy drinking or at least 4 binge-drinking episodes in a 30-day period. Binge drinking with such levels was associated with a 13-23% increased likelihood of reporting suboptimal self-rated health, when compared to the nonbinge drinkers.CONCLUSIONS: Binge drinking continues to be a serious public health concern. Frequent binge drinkers or binge drinkers who consume alcohol heavily are especially at risk of suboptimal self-rated health. Our findings underscore the importance of broad-based implementation in health care settings of screening for and brief interventions to address alcohol misuse, as well as the continuing need to implement effective population-based prevention strategies to reduce alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.","Division of Adult and Community Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30341, USA. jxt9@cdc.gov",2010,10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01231.x
194,,20485689,The 2010 Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations for the management of hypertension: part 2 - therapy.,"OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of hypertension in adults for 2010.OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, randomized trials and systematic reviews of trials were preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given the general lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field. Progressive renal impairment was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease.EVIDENCE: A Cochrane Collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE search from 2008 to August 2009 to update the 2009 recommendations. To identify additional studies, reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and methodological experts using prespecified levels of evidence.RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle modifications to prevent and treat hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to 1500 mg (65 mmol) per day in adults 50 years of age or younger, to 1300 mg (57 mmol) per day in adults 51 to 70 years of age, and to 1200 mg (52 mmol) per day in adults older than 70 years of age; perform 30 min to 60 min of moderate aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (less than 102 cm for men and less than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 standard drinks per week for men or nine standard drinks per week for women; follow a diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources, and that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol; and consider stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to less than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other agents, considerations for initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics, angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present to suggest consideration of dual therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events, should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength of the evidence and voted on by the 63 members of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations reported here achieved at least 80% consensus. These guidelines will continue to be updated annually.SPONSORS: The Canadian Hypertension Education Program process is sponsored by the Canadian Hypertension Society, Blood Pressure Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the College of Family Physicians of Canada, the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Canadian Council of Cardiovascular Nurses, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.","Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Clinical Neurological Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario. dhackam@uwo.ca",2010,NA

Each individual was followed for up to 2 years in naturalistic practice with blinded research assessments, while subgroups participated in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for bipolar depression. The naturalistic database was used to examine the course of BD, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and suicidality. Relevant studies in English, published from January 1, 1994, to May 31, 2009, were identified using computerized searches of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials), inspection of bibliographies, and review of other major reports.RESULTS: One large RCT involving the addition of either paroxetine or bupropion to mood stabilizers in acute depression found neither more effective than placebo in achieving sustained recovery (8 weeks of euthymia). A second large RCT found intensive psychosocial interventions superior to a brief psychosocial intervention as an adjunct to medication in acute depression. A third small RCT found minimal effects of lamotrigine, risperidone, or inositol in refractory depression. Recovery was difficult to achieve, with subsyndromal symptoms or full relapse very common. Anxiety disorders and smoking in particular were treatable conditions that adversely affected the course of BD.CONCLUSIONS: STEP-BD yielded numerous clinical and systems observations that provide fresh direction for research and treatment of BD, including setting new benchmarks for outcome and demonstrating the viability of large BD networks.","University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario. sagar.parikh@uhn.on.ca",2010,NA
196,,20331572,Risk perception and smoking behavior in medically ill smokers: a prospective study.,"AIMS: To examine the influence of risk perception on intentions to quit smoking and post-treatment abstinence.DESIGN: Prospective and longitudinal.SETTING: United States.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 237 adult smokers (mean age 56 years) receiving medical care from home health-care nurses. Participants did not have to want to quit smoking to participate, but received cessation counseling within the context of their medical care.MEASUREMENTS: Three measures of risk perception were given pre- and post-treatment: perceived vulnerability, optimistic bias and precaution effectiveness. Smoking status was verified biochemically at end of treatment and at 2, 6 and 12 months later.FINDINGS: Principal components analysis supported the theoretical discriminability of the risk perception measures, and intercorrelations provided evidence for concurrent and predictive validity. Elevated risk perception was associated with a variety of socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Optimistic bias was associated significantly with older age and ethnic minority status. Smokers in pre-contemplation had lower perceived vulnerability and precaution effectiveness and greater optimistic bias than those in contemplation and preparation. Smokers in preparation had higher perceived vulnerability and lower optimistic bias than those in earlier stages. Change in perceived vulnerability predicted smoking cessation at follow-up. Optimistic bias predicted a lower likelihood of cessation and precaution effectiveness predicted a greater likelihood of smoking cessation, but only among those with a smoking-related illness.CONCLUSIONS: In patients receiving medical care from home health-care nurses, change in perceived vulnerability to smoking-related disease is predictive of smoking cessation. In those with smoking-related illnesses, optimistic bias predicts continued smoking while precaution effectiveness predicts cessation.","Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and The Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI 02903, USA. belinda_borrelli@brown.edu",2010,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02900.x

The aim of the study was to evaluate if a structured initiative for improving care of patients with acute myocardial infarction (Guidelines Applied in Practice [GAP]) led to comparable care of white and nonwhite patients admitted to GAP hospitals in Michigan.METHODS: Medicare patients comprised 2 cohorts: (1) those admitted before GAP implementation (n = 1,368) and (2) those admitted after GAP implementation (n = 1,489). The main outcome measure was adherence to guideline-based medications/recommendations and use of the GAP discharge tool. chi(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to determine differences between white patients (n = 2,367) and nonwhite patients (n = 490).RESULTS: In-hospital GAP tool and aspirin use significantly improved for white and nonwhite patients. beta-Blocker use in hospital improved significantly for nonwhite patients only (66% vs 83.3%; P = .04). At discharge, nonwhite patients were 28% and 64% less likely than white patients to have had the GAP discharge tool used (P = .004) and receive smoking cessation counseling (P &lt; .001), respectively. Among white patients, GAP improved discharge prescription rates for aspirin by 10.8% (P &lt; .001) and beta-blockers by 7.0% (P = .047). Nonwhite patients' aspirin prescriptions increased by 1.0% and beta-blocker prescriptions decreased by 6.0% (both P values nonsignificant).CONCLUSIONS: The GAP program led to significant increases in rates of evidence-based care in both white and nonwhite Medicare patients. However, nonwhite patients received less quality improvement discharge tool and smoking cessation counseling. Policies designed to reduce racial disparities in health care must address disparity in the delivery of quality improvement programs.","Department of Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA. ade.olomu@hc.msu.edu",2010,10.1016/j.ahj.2009.12.014

Pregnant smokers (n = 42) were randomized regardless of their intention to quit smoking.METHODS: Participants were assigned to either usual care or intervention. Intervention participants received 15-minute Video Doctor sessions plus provider cueing, at baseline and one month, prior to their routine prenatal visit. The Video Doctor delivered interactive tailored messages, an educational worksheet for participants, and a cueing sheet for providers.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Receipt of advice from the provider and 30-day smoking abstinence, both by self-report.RESULTS: Intervention participants were more likely to receive provider advice on tobacco use at both prenatal visits during the intervention period (60.9 vs. 15.8%, p = 0.003). The intervention yielded a significantly greater decrease in the number of days smoked and in cigarettes smoked per day. The 30-day abstinence rate at two months post baseline was 2.5 times greater in the intervention group; the difference was not significant (26.1 vs. 10.5%, p = 0.12).CONCLUSIONS: The Video Doctor plus provider cueing is an efficacious adjunct to routine prenatal care by promoting provider advice and smoking reduction among pregnant smokers.","Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. jtsoh@lppi.ucsf.edu",2010,10.3109/00016341003678419
199,,20189638,"HIV prevention, treatment, and care services for people who inject drugs: a systematic review of global, regional, and national coverage.","BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have examined the existence of HIV prevention, treatment, and care services for injecting drug users (IDUs) worldwide, but they did not quantify the scale of coverage. We undertook a systematic review to estimate national, regional, and global coverage of HIV services in IDUs.METHODS: We did a systematic search of peer-reviewed (Medline, BioMed Central), internet, and grey-literature databases for data published in 2004 or later. A multistage process of data requests and verification was undertaken, involving UN agencies and national experts. National data were obtained for the extent of provision of the following core interventions for IDUs: needle and syringe programmes (NSPs), opioid substitution therapy (OST) and other drug treatment, HIV testing and counselling, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom programmes. We calculated national, regional, and global coverage of NSPs, OST, and ART on the basis of available estimates of IDU population sizes.FINDINGS: By 2009, NSPs had been implemented in 82 countries and OST in 70 countries; both interventions were available in 66 countries. Regional and national coverage varied substantially. Australasia (202 needle-syringes per IDU per year) had by far the greatest rate of needle-syringe distribution; Latin America and the Caribbean (0.3 needle-syringes per IDU per year), Middle East and north Africa (0.5 needle-syringes per IDU per year), and sub-Saharan Africa (0.1 needle-syringes per IDU per year) had the lowest rates. OST coverage varied from less than or equal to one recipient per 100 IDUs in central Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa, to very high levels in western Europe (61 recipients per 100 IDUs). The number of IDUs receiving ART varied from less than one per 100 HIV-positive IDUs (Chile, Kenya, Pakistan, Russia, and Uzbekistan) to more than 100 per 100 HIV-positive IDUs in six European countries. Worldwide, an estimated two needle-syringes (range 1-4) were distributed per IDU per month, there were eight recipients (6-12) of OST per 100 IDUs, and four IDUs (range 2-18) received ART per 100 HIV-positive IDUs.INTERPRETATION: Worldwide coverage of HIV prevention, treatment, and care services in IDU populations is very low. There is an urgent need to improve coverage of these services in this at-risk population.FUNDING: UN Office on Drugs and Crime; Australian National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales; and Australian National Health and Medical Research Council.","National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. b.mathers@unsw.edu.au",2010,10.1016/S0140-6736(10)60232-2
200,,20172378,Outcomes of laser thermal therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: To review the outcomes of a phase II study using laser-induced thermal therapy (LITT) as a palliative treatment for 106 patients with recurrent head and neck tumors.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.SETTING: Tertiary hospital in the United States.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The primary endpoints were tumor response and survival. Prognostic values were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.RESULTS: The best results were seen in oral cavity tumors, in which mean survival was 29.1 months, as compared to neck tumors (mean 14.4 +/- 6.9 months; range 7.5-20.7 months; with a 95% confidence interval). Further analysis showed that clinical factors such as gender, smoking, and alcohol use were not indicators of poor prognosis, whereas neck disease and tumor stage at first treatment were relevant factors.CONCLUSION: In this study, 40 out of 106 patients treated by LITT remained alive at the end of our follow-up, and a complete response was seen in 24 (22.6%) patients. The highest response rate was seen in oral cavity tumors, which suggests that tumor location at this site may be a predictor of favorable outcome with LITT.","Department of Surgery, Division of Head and Neck Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.",2010,10.1016/j.otohns.2009.11.019

We assessed: (i) the burden of NCD risk factors; (ii) estimated the relations of behavioural risk factors to socio-demographic correlates, anthropometric risk factors with behavioural risk factors; (iii) evaluated if socio-demographic, behavioural and anthropometric risk factors predicted biochemical risk factors; and (iv) estimated awareness, treatment and adequacy of control of hypertension and diabetes, in Kerala state.METHODS: A total of 7449 individuals (51% women) stratified by age group, sex and place of residence were selected and information on behavioural risk factors; tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol use, measured anthropometry, blood pressure was collected. Fasting blood samples were analysed for blood glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides in a sample subset.Using multiple logistic regression models the associations between socio-demographic and anthropometric variables with biochemical risk factors were estimated.RESULTS: The burden of NCD risk factors was high in our sample. Prevalence of behavioural and each of the biochemical risk factors increased with age, adjusting for other factors including sex and the place of residence. The odds ratios relating anthropometric variables to biochemical variables were modest, suggesting that anthropometric variables may not be useful surrogates for biochemical risk factors for population screening purposes.INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSIONS: In this large study of community-based sample in Kerala, high burden of NCD risk factors was observed, comparable to that in the United States. These data may serve to propel multisectoral efforts to lower the community burden of NCD risk factors in India in general, and in Kerala, in particular.","Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies, Department of Biochemistry, Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute for Medical Sciences &amp; Technology, Thiruvananthapuram, India. kavumpurathu@yahoo.com",2010,NA
202,,20105410,Brief physician advice for heavy drinking college students: a randomized controlled trial in college health clinics.,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of brief physician advice in reducing alcohol use and related harm in college students.METHOD: The College Health Intervention Projects (CHIPs) is a randomized, controlled clinical trial with 12-month follow-up conducted in five college health clinics in Wisconsin; Washington state; and Vancouver, Canada. Of the 12,900 students screened for high-risk drinking, 484 men and 502 women met inclusion criteria and were randomized into a control (n = 493) or intervention (n = 493) group. Ninety-six percent of students participated in the follow-up procedures. The intervention consisted of two 15-minute counseling visits and two follow-up phone calls, and used motivational interviewing, contracting, diary cards, and take-home exercises.RESULTS: No significant differences were found between groups at baseline on alcohol use, age, socioeconomic or smoking status, rates of depression, or measures of alcohol-related harm. At 12 months, the experimental subjects reduced their 28-day drinking totals by 27.2%, and the control group reduced their totals by 21%. A mixed effects repeated measures model found a statistical difference in favor of the brief-intervention group (beta = 4.7, SE = 2.0, p = .018) in 28-day drinking totals. The total Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index score was also significantly different during the 12-month follow-up period (beta = 0.8, SE = 0.4, p = .033). There was no difference on the other outcome measures of interest, such as frequency of excessive heavy drinking, health care utilization, injuries, drunk driving, depression, or tobacco use.CONCLUSIONS: The study supports resource allocation and implementation of alcohol screening and brief physician advice in primary care-based college health clinics.","Department of Family Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1100 Delaplaine Court, Madison, Wisconsin 53715, USA. mfflemin@wisc.edu",2010,NA

204,,23074395,Stenting for peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities: an evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: In January 2010, the Medical Advisory Secretariat received an application from University Health Network to provide an evidentiary platform on stenting as a treatment management for peripheral artery disease. The purpose of this health technology assessment is to examine the effectiveness of primary stenting as a treatment management for peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities.CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a progressive disease occurring as a result of plaque accumulation (atherosclerosis) in the arterial system that carries blood to the extremities (arms and legs) as well as vital organs. The vessels that are most affected by PAD are the arteries of the lower extremities, the aorta, the visceral arterial branches, the carotid arteries and the arteries of the upper limbs. In the lower extremities, PAD affects three major arterial segments i) aortic-iliac, ii) femoro-popliteal (FP) and iii) infra-popliteal (primarily tibial) arteries. The disease is commonly classified clinically as asymptomatic claudication, rest pain and critical ischemia. Although the prevalence of PAD in Canada is not known, it is estimated that 800,000 Canadians have PAD. The 2007 Trans Atlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) II Working Group for the Management of Peripheral Disease estimated that the prevalence of PAD in Europe and North America to be 27 million, of whom 88,000 are hospitalizations involving lower extremities. A higher prevalence of PAD among elderly individuals has been reported to range from 12% to 29%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated that the prevalence of PAD is 14.5% among individuals 70 years of age and over. Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated with PAD include advanced age, male gender, family history, smoking, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. PAD is a strong predictor of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke and cardiovascular death. Annually, approximately 10% of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events can be attributed to the progression of PAD. Compared with patients without PAD, the 10-year risk of all-cause mortality is 3-fold higher in patients with PAD with 4-5 times greater risk of dying from cardiovascular event. The risk of coronary heart disease is 6 times greater and increases 15-fold in patients with advanced or severe PAD. Among subjects with diabetes, the risk of PAD is often severe and associated with extensive arterial calcification. In these patients the risk of PAD increases two to four fold. The results of the Canadian public survey of knowledge of PAD demonstrated that Canadians are unaware of the morbidity and mortality associated with PAD. Despite its prevalence and cardiovascular risk implications, only 25% of PAD patients are undergoing treatment. The diagnosis of PAD is difficult as most patients remain asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms do not present until there is at least 50% narrowing of an artery. In the general population, only 10% of persons with PAD have classic symptoms of claudication, 40% do not complain of leg pain, while the remaining 50% have a variety of leg symptoms different from classic claudication. The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of stenosis. The need to intervene is more urgent in patients with limb threatening ischemia as manifested by night pain, rest pain, ischemic ulcers or gangrene. Without successful revascularization those with critical ischemia have a limb loss (amputation) rate of 80-90% in one year. Diagnosis of PAD is generally non-invasive and can be performed in the physician offices or on an outpatient basis in a hospital. Most common diagnostic procedure include: 1) Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), a ratio of the blood pressure readings between the highest ankle pressure and the highest brachial (arm) pressure; and 2) Doppler ultrasonography, a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of ultrasound and wave form recordings to evaluate arterial flow in blood vessels. The value of the ABI can provide an assessment of the severity of the disease. Other non invasive imaging techniques include: Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA). Definitive diagnosis of PAD can be made by an invasive catheter based angiography procedure which shows the roadmap of the arteries, depicting the exact location and length of the stenosis / occlusion. Angiography is the standard method against which all other imaging procedures are compared for accuracy. More than 70% of the patients diagnosed with PAD remain stable or improve with conservative management of pharmacologic agents and life style modifications. Significant PAD symptoms are well known to negatively influence an individual quality of life. For those who do not improve, revascularization methods either invasive or non-invasive can be used to restore peripheral circulation. TECHNOLOGY UNDER REVIEW: A Stent is a wire mesh &quot;scaffold&quot; that is permanently implanted in the artery to keep the artery open and can be combined with angioplasty to treat PAD. There are two types of stents: i) balloon-expandable and ii) self expandable stents and are available in varying length. The former uses an angioplasty balloon to expand and set the stent within the arterial segment. Recently, drug-eluting stents have been developed and these types of stents release small amounts of medication intended to reduce neointimal hyperplasia, which can cause re-stenosis at the stent site. Endovascular stenting avoids the problem of early elastic recoil, residual stenosis and flow limiting dissection after balloon angioplasty.RESEARCH QUESTIONS: In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), is primary stenting more effective than percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in improving patency?In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), does primary stenting provide immediate success compared to PTA?In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), is primary stenting associated with less complications compared to PTA?In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), does primary stenting compared to PTA reduce the rate of re-intervention?In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion) is primary stenting more effective than PTA in improving clinical and hemodynamic success?Are drug eluting stents more effective than bare stents in improving patency, reducing rates of re-interventions or complications?LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on February 2, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, OVID EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA). Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. The quality of evidence was assessed as high, moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology.INCLUSION CRITERIA: English language full-reports from 1950 to January Week 3, 2010Comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of RCTsProven diagnosis of PAD of the lower extremities in all patients.Adult patients at least 18 years of age.Stent as at least one treatment arm.Patency, re-stenosis, re-intervention, technical success, hemodynamic (ABI) and clinical improvement and complications as at least an outcome.EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Non-randomized studiesObservational studies (cohort or retrospective studies) and case reportFeasibility studiesStudies that have evaluated stent but not as a primary interventionOUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome measure was patency. Secondary measures included technical success, re-intervention, complications, hemodynamic (ankle brachial pressure index, treadmill walking distance) and clinical success or improvement according to Rutherford scale. It was anticipated, a priori, that there would be substantial differences among trials regarding the method of examination and definitions of patency or re-stenosis. Where studies reported only re-stenosis rates, patency rates were calculated as 1 minus re-stenosis rates.STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Odds ratios (for binary outcomes) or mean difference (for continuous outcomes) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each endpoint. An intention to treat principle (ITT) was used, with the total number of patients randomized to each study arm as the denominator for each proportion. Sensitivity analysis was performed using per protocol approach. A pooled odds ratio (POR) or mean difference for each endpoint was then calculated for all trials reporting that endpoint using a fixed effects model. PORs were calculated for comparisons of primary stenting versus PTA or other alternative procedures. Level of significance was set at alpha=0.05. Homogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test, I(2) and by visual inspection of forest plots. If heterogeneity was encountered within groups (P &lt; 0.10), a random effects model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5. Where sufficient data were available, these analyses were repeated within subgroups of patients defined by time of outcome assessment to evaluate sustainability of treatment benefit.

205,,19959683,The association between cigarette smoking and risk of colorectal cancer in a large prospective cohort from the United States.,"BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported a 20% to 60% increase in risk of colorectal cancer associated with active smoking. However, neither the U.S. Surgeon General nor the IARC have classified the relationship as causal because of concern about residual confounding.METHODS: In a prospective study of 184,187 people followed from 1992 to 2005, we used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the relationship of cigarette smoking to incident colorectal cancer, controlling for screening and multiple known and putative risk factors. Information on smoking and time-varying covariates was updated in 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003.RESULTS: The incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly higher in current [hazard ratios (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.06-1.52] and former smokers (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36) compared with lifelong nonsmokers in analyses that controlled for 13 covariates, including screening. The relative risk was greatest among current smokers with at least 50 years of smoking (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.84). Among former smokers, risk of colorectal cancer decreased with greater time since cessation (P trend = 0.0003), and also decreased with earlier age at cessation (P trend = 0.0014). No association was seen among former smokers who had quit before age of 40 years or abstained for 31 years or more.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term cigarette smoking is associated with colorectal cancer, even after controlling for screening and multiple other risk factors.","Department of Epidemiology, American Cancer Society, Atlanta, Georgia 30303-1002, USA.",2009,10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0661
206,,19919597,Ethnic differences in drinking outcomes following a brief alcohol intervention in the trauma care setting.,"BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that brief interventions in the trauma care setting reduce drinking, subsequent injury and driving under the influence (DUI) arrest. However, evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in ethnic minority groups is lacking. The current study evaluates the efficacy of brief intervention among whites, blacks and Hispanics in the United States.METHODS: We conducted a two-group parallel randomized trial comparing brief motivational intervention (BMI) and treatment as usual with assessment (TAU+) to evaluate treatment differences in drinking patterns by ethnicity. Patients were recruited from a level 1 urban trauma center over a 2-year period. The study included 1493 trauma patients, including 668 whites, 288 blacks and 537 Hispanics. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to evaluate ethnic differences in drinking outcomes including volume per week, maximum amount consumed in 1 day, percentage days abstinent and percentage days heavy drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Analyses controlled for age, gender, employment status, marital status, prior alcohol treatment, type of injury and injury severity. Special emphasis was given to potential ethnic differences by testing the interaction between ethnicity and BMI.RESULTS: At 6- and 12-month follow-up, BMI significantly reduced maximum amount consumed in 1 day (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.001, respectively) and percentage days heavy drinking (P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.05, respectively) among Hispanics. Hispanics in the BMI group also reduced average volume per week at 12-month follow-up (chi(2) = 6.8, df = 1, P &lt; 0.01). In addition, Hispanics in TAU+ reduced maximum amount consumed at 6- and 12-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.001) and volume per week at 12-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). Whites and blacks in both BMI and TAU+ reduced volume per week and percentage days heavy drinking at 12-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001; P &lt; 0.01, respectively) and decreased maximum amount at 6- (P &lt; 0.001) and 12-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001). All three ethnic groups In both BMI and TAU+ reduced volume per week at 6-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) and percentage days abstinent at 6- (P &lt; 0.001) and 12-month follow-up (P &lt; 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: All three ethnic groups evidenced reductions in drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up independent of treatment assignment. Among Hispanics, BMI reduced alcohol intake significantly as measured by average volume per week, percentage days heavy drinking and maximum amount consumed in 1 day.","University of Texas at Austin, School of Social Work, Center for Social Work Research, Health Behavior Research and Training Institute, Austin, TX 78703, USA. craig.field@austin.utexas.edu",2009,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02737.x

References of the chosen articles were also examined.STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected based on their relevance to the subject matter and currency.RESULTS: The current US smoking rate far exceeds the desired national goal established by Healthy People 2010. Efforts have been made by the US Public Health Department to streamline the treatment of smoking use and dependence for all physicians. Published research strongly supports the negative impact smoking has on asthma, chronic rhinitis, allergic sensitization, and immunodeficiency disorders.CONCLUSIONS: Allergists know the significant impact that smoking has and will make on the lives and health of patients. It is important for these specialists to make an impact on the chronic disease of tobacco addiction because it directly affects the care rendered. By using the standardized tobacco use treatment concept of the 5 A's (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange), allergists can make a positive impact on reducing US smoking rates and improve patient health. Screening, providing brief counseling, and prescribing first-line smoking cessation medications will help the United States get closer to achieving the national goal laid out in Healthy People 2010 of smoking rates of 12% or less.","Department of Allergy and Immunology, Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas, USA. kimberly.johnson@lackland.af.mil",2009,10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60524-8
208,,19803579,A multisite randomized effectiveness trial of motivational enhancement therapy for Spanish-speaking substance users.,"Hispanic individuals are underrepresented in clinical and research populations and are often excluded from clinical trials in the United States. Hence, there are few data on the effectiveness of most empirically validated therapies for Hispanic substance users. The authors conducted a multisite randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of 3 individual sessions of motivational enhancement therapy with that of 3 individual sessions of counseling as usual on treatment retention and frequency of substance use; all assessment and treatment sessions were conducted in Spanish among 405 individuals seeking treatment for any type of current substance use. Treatment exposure was good, with 66% of participants completing all 3 protocol sessions. Although both interventions resulted in reductions in substance use during the 4-week therapy phase, there were no significant Treatment Condition x Time interactions nor Site x Treatment Condition interactions. Results suggest that the individual treatments delivered in Spanish were both attractive to and effective with this heterogeneous group of Hispanic adults, but the differential effectiveness of motivational enhancement therapy may be limited to those whose primary substance use problem is alcohol and may be fairly modest in magnitude.","Department of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, West Haven, CT 06519, USA. kathleen.carroll@yale.edu",2009,10.1037/a0016489
209,,19722340,Do Canadian prenatal record forms integrate evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis of a FASD?,"OBJECTIVES: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines.METHODS: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian province and territory (N = 12) was conducted to identify all questions or intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment, counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines and the FASD literature.RESULTS: All the prenatal record forms contained questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories. Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking behaviour.CONCLUSION: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating early diagnosis of a FASD.","Faculty of Nursing, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB.",2009,NA

Those setting a quit date received self-help quitting materials and NRT. ME participants received four sessions of motivational counseling and a quit-day counseling call. All ME intervention materials were tailored to the needs of HIV+ individuals.MEASUREMENTS: Biochemically verified 7-day abstinence rates at 2-month, 4-month and 6-month follow-ups.FINDINGS: Intent-to-treat (ITT) abstinence rates at 2-month, 4-month and 6-month follow-ups were 12%, 9% and 9%, respectively, in the ME condition, and 13%, 10% and 10%, respectively, in the SC condition, indicating no between-group differences. Among 412 participants with treatment utilization data, 6-month ITT abstinence rates were associated positively with low nicotine dependence (P = 0.02), high motivation to quit (P = 0.04) and Hispanic American race/ethnicity (P = 0.02). Adjusting for these variables, each additional NRT contact improved the odds of smoking abstinence by a third (odds ratio = 1.32, 95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.75).CONCLUSIONS: Motivationally enhanced treatment plus NRT did not improve cessation rates over and above standard care treatment plus NRT in this HIV+ sample of smokers. Providers offering brief support and encouraging use of nicotine replacement may be able to help HIV+ patients to quit smoking.","Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, The Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Centers for Behavioral and Preventive Medicine, The Miriam Hospital, Providence, RI, USA. erichardson@umassd.edu",2009,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02623.x
211,,19707607,Best practices for smoking cessation interventions in primary care.,"BACKGROUND: In Canada, smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death. Family physicians and nurse practitioners are uniquely positioned to initiate smoking cessation. Because smoking is a chronic addiction, repeated, opportunity-based interventions are most effective in addressing physical dependence and modifying deeply ingrained patterns of beliefs and behaviour. However, only a small minority of family physicians provide thorough smoking cessation counselling and less than one-half offer adjunct support to patients.OBJECTIVE: To identify the key steps family physicians and nurse practitioners can take to strengthen effective smoking cessation interventions for their patients.METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of health care practitioners involved with smoking cessation from across Canada was convened to discuss best practices derived from international guidelines, including those from the United States, Europe, and Australia, and other relevant literature. The panellists subsequently refined their findings in the form of the present article.RESULTS: The present paper outlines best practices for brief and effective counselling for, and treatment of, tobacco addiction. By adopting a simple series of questions, taking 30 s to 3 min to complete, health care professionals can initiate smoking cessation interventions. Integrating these strategies into daily practice provides opportunities to significantly improve the quality and duration of patients' lives.CONCLUSION: Tobacco addiction is the most important preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada. Family physicians, nurse practitioners and other front-line health care professionals are well positioned to influence and assist their patients in quitting, thereby reducing the burden on both personal health and the public health care system.","Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health, St Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, Ontario. amcivor@stjospham.on.ca",2009,NA
212,,19700437,The adoption of smoke-free hospital campuses in the United States.,"BACKGROUND: The adoption of a smoke-free hospital campus policy is often a highly publicised local event. National media coverage suggests that the trend towards adopting these policies is growing, and this publicity can frequently lead hospital administrators to consider the adoption of such policies within their own institutions. Little is actually known, however, about the prevalence of these policies or their impact.OBJECTIVES: To determine the national prevalence of smoke-free hospital campus policies and the relation between these policies and performance on nationally standardised measures for smoking cessation counselling in US hospitals.METHODS: 4494 Joint Commission-accredited hospitals were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire assessing current smoking policies and future plans. Smoking cessation counselling rates were assessed through nationally standardised measures.RESULTS: The 1916 hospitals responding to the survey (43%) were statistically similar to non-responders with respect to performance measure rates, smoking policies and demographic characteristics. Approximately 45% of responders reported an existing smoke-free hospital campus policy. With respect to demographics, higher proportions of smoke-free campus policies were reported in non-teaching and non-profit hospitals. Smoke-free campus hospitals were also more likely to provide smoking cessation counselling to patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and pneumonia who smoke (p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: By February 2008, 45% of US hospitals (up from approximately 3% in 1992) had adopted a smoke-free campus policy; another 15% reported actively pursuing the adoption of such a policy. By the end of 2009, it is likely that the majority of US hospitals will have a smoke-free campus.","The Joint Commission, Oakbrook Terrace, IL 60181, USA. swilliams@jointcommission.org",2009,10.1136/tc.2009.030494
213,,19595518,Effects of topiramate or naltrexone on tobacco use among male alcohol-dependent outpatients.,"BACKGROUND: A high smoking prevalence has been registered among alcoholics. It has been pointed out that alcoholic smokers may have a more severe course and greater severity of alcoholism. This study aims at comparing smoking and non-smoking alcoholics in terms of treatment outcomes and verifying the efficacy of topiramate and naltrexone to decrease the use of cigarettes among alcoholic smokers.METHODS: The investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study carried out at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. The sample comprised 155 male alcohol-dependent outpatients (52 non-smokers and 103 smokers), 18-60 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence. After a 1-week detoxification period, the patients randomly received placebo, naltrexone (50mg/day) or topiramate (up to 300 mg/day). Only the alcoholic smokers who adhered to the treatment were evaluated with reference to the smoking reduction.RESULTS: Cox regression analysis revealed that the smoking status among alcoholics increased the odds of relapse into drinking by 65%, independently of the medications prescribed, using the intention-to-treat method. Topiramate showed effectiveness to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked when compared to placebo among adherent patients (mean difference=7.91, p&lt;0.01). There were no significant differences between the naltrexone group and the placebo group.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study confirm that the treatment is more challenging for smoking alcoholics than for non-smoking ones and support the efficacy of topiramate in the smoking reduction among male alcoholic smokers who adhered to the treatment.","Department of Psychiatry of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. dbaltieri@uol.com.br",2009,10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.05.025
214,,19581545,Project ALERT: a cluster randomized trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Project ALERT on adolescents' lifetime and 30-day use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants.DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial.SETTING: Schools from 11 states were enrolled in 2 successive cohorts from 2004 to 2008.PARTICIPANTS: All public schools in the United States that included grades 6 through 8 and enrolled at least 100 students in sixth grade were recruited. Of the 40 schools that began the study, 34 (17 per condition) completed it. Data were analyzed from 5883 unique participants. Intervention Project ALERT, a manualized classroom-based substance use prevention curriculum for the middle grades, was taught to sixth and seventh graders.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Students were surveyed before the onset of the intervention, as sixth graders, and after the completion of the 2-year intervention, as seventh graders. Outcome measures included lifetime and 30-day use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants.RESULTS: At baseline, students in the intervention condition were slightly to moderately more likely to report use for each of the 8 measures examined than were students in the control condition. For all measures except lifetime use of cigarettes, these differences were less pronounced at follow-up and therefore were in the direction of favorable program effects. These changes were statistically significant, however, for only 1 outcome measure, past 30-day use of alcohol (reduction in the adjusted odds ratio from 2.07 at baseline to 1.32 at follow-up; P = .006).CONCLUSION: Project ALERT was not effective when delivered to the sixth grade population we targeted.","Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 1516 E Franklin Street, Chapel Hill, NC 27514, USA. ringwalt@pire.org",2009,10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.88

All participants were sanctioned by the university's judicial office for an alcohol- or drug-related violation. Participants were randomized to one of two intervention conditions (the University Assistance Program or services as usual) and were assessed at baseline and 3 and 6 months after intervention.RESULTS: Growth curve analyses showed that, relative to services as usual, the University Assistance Program was more efficacious in reducing past-90-day weekday alcohol consumption and the number of alcohol-related consequences while increasing past-90-day use of protective behaviors and coping skills. No significant differences in growth trajectories were found between the two intervention conditions on past-90-day blood alcohol concentration, total alcohol consumption, or weekend consumption.CONCLUSIONS: The University Assistance Program may have a possible advantage over services as usual for mandated students.","Institute on Urban Health Research, Bouvé College of Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Boston, MA 02115, USA. h.amaro@neu.edu",2009,NA

We examined the efficacy of an intervention for smoking cessation for patients admitted to hospital for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or because of acute myocardial infarction (MI).METHODS: Nurses randomly assigned 276 sequential patients admitted because of acute MI or for CABG who met the inclusion criteria. Participants received an intensive or minimal smoking-cessation intervention. The minimal intervention included advice from physicians and nurses and 2 pamphlets. The intensive intervention included the minimal intervention plus 60 minutes of bedside counselling, take-home materials and 7 nurse-initiated counselling calls for 2 months after discharge. The outcomes were point prevalence of abstinence at 3, 6 and 12 months after discharge.RESULTS: The 12-month self-reported rate of abstinence was 62% among patients in the intensive group and 46% among those in the minimal group (odds ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.1). Abstinence was confirmed for 54% of patients in the intensive group and 35% in the minimal group (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.6). Abstinence was significantly lower among those who used pharmacotherapy than among those who did not (p &lt; 0.001). Continuous 12-month abstinence was 57% in the intensive group and 39% in the minimal group (p &lt; 0.01). It was significantly higher among patients admitted for CABG than among those admitted because of acute MI (p &lt; 0.05).INTERPRETATION: Providing intensive programs for smoking cessation for patients admitted for CABG or because of acute MI could have a major impact on health and health care costs.","Human Science Division, Northern Ontario School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alta. patricia.smith@normed.ca",2009,10.1503/cmaj.080862
217,,19455106,Management and treatment of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension: recommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Resource Center Program and the National Hepatitis C Program.,"Cirrhosis represents the end stage of any chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C and alcohol are currently the main causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Although initially cirrhosis is compensated, it eventually becomes decompensated, as defined by the presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and/or jaundice. These management recommendations are divided according to the status, compensated or decompensated, of the cirrhotic patient, with a separate section for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as this applies to patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In the compensated patient, the main objective is to prevent variceal hemorrhage and any practice that could lead to decompensation. In the decompensated patient, acute variceal hemorrhage and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are severe complications that require hospitalization. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a severe complication of cirrhosis but one that usually occurs in patients who are already in the hospital and, as it represents an extreme of the hemodynamic alterations that lead to ascites formation, it is placed under treatment of ascites. Recent advances in the pathophysiology of the complications of cirrhosis have allowed for a more rational management of cirrhosis and also for the stratification of patients into different risk groups that require different management. These recommendations are based on evidence in the literature, mainly from randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses of these trials. When few or no data exist from well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series and consensus conferences with involvement of recognized experts. A rational management of cirrhosis will result in improvements in quality of life, treatment adherence, and, ultimately, in outcomes.","Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, West Haven, Connecticut, USA. guadalupe.garcia-tsao@yale.edu",2009,10.1038/ajg.2009.191

This study evaluated the efficacy of a minimal-contact ST cessation program in military personnel.METHODS: Participants were recruited from 24 military dental clinics across the United States during annual dental examinations. Participants were 785 active-duty military personnel who were randomly assigned to receive a minimal-contact behavioral treatment (n = 392) or usual care (n = 393). The behavioral treatment included an ST cessation manual, a videotape cessation guide tailored for military personnel, and three 15-min telephone counseling sessions using motivational interviewing methods. Usual care consisted of standard procedures that are part of the annual dental examination, including recommendations to quit using ST and referral to extant local tobacco cessation programs. Participants were assessed at 3 and 6 months after enrollment.RESULTS: Participants in the ST cessation program were significantly more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco, as assessed by repeated point prevalence at both 3 and 6 months (25.0%), and were significantly more likely to be abstinent from ST use for 6 months, as assessed by prolonged abstinence (16.8%), compared with participants in usual care (7.6% and 6.4%, respectively).DISCUSSION: These results indicate that a minimal-contact behavioral treatment can significantly reduce ST use in military personnel and has the potential for widespread dissemination. If ST users were identified in dental visits and routinely referred to telephone counseling, this could have a substantial benefit for the health and well-being of military personnel.","Oregon Research Institute, 1715 Franklin Boulevard, Eugene, OR 97403, USA. herb@ori.org",2009,10.1093/ntr/ntp057

Of 13 population clusters, seven were randomly allocated to three rounds of screening between 1996 and 2004, while standard care was provided in six (control arm). An activity-based approach was employed to calculate costs associated with various components of the screening trial. Information on the resources used and on clinical events in each trial arm was derived from trial databases. Total costs for each cluster were estimated in 2004 United States dollars (US$). The incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated for all eligible individuals and for high-risk individuals (i.e. tobacco or alcohol users).FINDINGS: The proportion of oral cancers detected at an early stage (i.e. stage I or II) was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm (42% versus 24%, respectively). The incremental cost per life-year saved was US$ 835 for all individuals eligible for screening and US$ 156 for high-risk individuals. Oral cancer screening by visual inspection was performed for under US$ 6 per person.CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective approach to oral cancer screening by visual inspection is to offer it to the high-risk population. Targeted screening of this group will ensure that screening can be offered at a reasonable cost in a limited-resource setting.","RTI International, Massachusetts, MA, United States of America. ssubramanian@rti.org",2009,S0042-96862009000300014
220,,19372602,Screening and recording of alcohol use among women of child-bearing age and pregnant women.,"A woman's alcohol use during pregnancy is one of the top preventable causes of birth defects and developmental disabilities that are known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The social and economic burden of FASD is substantial. Lifetime direct tangible costs per individual related to health care, education and social services in Canada have been estimated to be $1.4 million. Screening women of child-bearing age and pregnant women and recording their alcohol consumption is a practical process to identify and evaluate women at-risk and to identify potentially exposed infants. The FASD Advisory Workgroup proposes the following three levels of screenings which should be done on consenting women: Level I screening involves practice-based approaches that can be used by health care providers when talking to women about alcohol use, such as motivational interviewing and supportive dialogue. Level II screening includes a number of structured questionnaires that can be used with direct questioning (TLFB) or indirect /masked screening (AUDIT, BMAST / SMAST, CAGE, CRAFFT, T-ACE, TWEAK). Level III screening includes laboratory-based tools that can be used to confirm the presence of a drug, its level of exposure and determine the presence of multiple drugs. There are challenges and limitations in the use of the screening and assessment tools outlined. For example, the single question about alcohol use and the various questionnaires rely on a woman to provide details about her alcohol use. There is no consensus on the appropriate screening to use across Canada as each provincial / territorial jurisdiction, health care organization and healthcare provider uses a variety of formal and informal screening tool. In addition, there are inconsistent processes across Canada for the recording of the alcohol use in a woman's chart and the transfer of the information to the infant and the child's health records. The FASD Advisory Workgroup proposes eleven recommendations to improve the screening and recording processes for alcohol use in women of child-bearing age and pregnant women.",NA,2009,NA

222,,19327965,Interventions for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs): overview of findings for five innovative research projects.,"It is well established that prenatal exposure to alcohol causes damage to the developing fetus, resulting in a spectrum of disorders known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Although our understanding of the deficits and disturbances associated with FASDs is far from complete, there are consistent findings indicating these are serious, lifelong disabilities-especially when these disabilities result from central nervous system damage. Until recently, information and strategies for interventions specific to individuals with FASDs have been gleaned from interventions used with people with other disabilities and from the practical wisdom gained by parents and clinicians through trial and error or shared through informal networks. Although informative to a limited degree, such interventions have been implemented without being evaluated systematically or scientifically. The purpose of this article is to provide a brief overview of a general intervention framework developed for individuals with FASDs and the methods and general findings of five specific intervention research studies conducted within this framework. The studies evaluated five different interventions in five diverse locations in the United States, with different segments of the FASD population. Nonetheless, all participants showed improvement in the target behaviors or skills, with four studies achieving statistical significance in treatment outcomes. Important lessons emerged from these five interventions that may explain success: including parent education or training, teaching children specific skills they would usually learn by observation or abstraction, and integration into existing systems of treatment. A major implication of these research studies for families dealing with FASDs is that there are now interventions available that can address their children's needs and that can be presented as scientifically validated and efficacious to intervention agents such as schools, social services, and mental health providers. In the field of FASD research and clinical service, a common theme reported by families has been that clinicians and professionals have been reluctant to diagnose their children because there were no known effective treatments. Results of these five studies dispel that concern by demonstrating several interventions that have been shown to improve the lives of individuals with FASDs and their families.","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA 30329, United States. jbertrand@cdc.gov",2009,10.1016/j.ridd.2009.02.003

Three groups were formed: never smokers, current, and past smokers. The prevalence of hr-HPV infection and CIN were compared between the study groups. In the prospective analysis, women were controlled at 6-month intervals to assess the cumulative risk of incident hr-HPV infection, smear abnormalities, and CIN.RESULTS: A higher prevalence (21.7%) of hr-HPV infection was found among current smokers as compared to never smokers (16.5%) or past smokers (13.5%). Being current smoker was significantly (P &lt;0.01) associated with hr-HPV detection (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.1). Being a current smoker was a significant predictor of incident hr-HPV during the follow-up [Hazards ratio (HR) = 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-1.9]. For incident CIN2+, being a past smoker (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.6-9.8) or current smoker (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5-8.6) were the significant independent predictors. Current and past smokers had a significantly increased risk of incident CIN2+ (P &lt;0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Smoking increases the risk of contracting hr-HPV infection and modifies the effect of a persistent hr-HPV infection by further increasing the risk of developing CIN2+. It seems that this effect modification persists over several years after smoking cessation.","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil.",2009,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181935a7d

225,,19190293,Evaluation of an evidence-based tobacco treatment curriculum for psychiatry residency training programs.,"OBJECTIVE: Smokers with mental illness and addictive disorders account for nearly one in two cigarettes sold in the United States and are at high risk for smoking-related deaths and disability. Psychiatry residency programs provide a unique arena for disseminating tobacco treatment guidelines, influencing professional norms, and increasing access to tobacco cessation services among smokers with mental illness. The current study evaluated the Rx for Change in Psychiatry curriculum, developed for psychiatry residency programs and focused on identifying and treating tobacco dependence among individuals with mental illness.METHODS: The 4-hour curriculum emphasized evidence-based, patient-oriented cessation treatments relevant for all tobacco users, including those not yet ready to quit. The curriculum was informed by comprehensive literature review, consultation with an expert advisory group, faculty interviews, and a focus group with psychiatry residents. This study reports on evaluation of the curriculum in 2005-2006, using a quasi-experimental design, with 55 residents in three psychiatry residency training programs in Northern California.RESULTS: The curriculum was associated with improvements in psychiatry residents' knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and counseling behaviors for treating tobacco use among their patients, with initial changes from pre- to posttraining sustained at 3-months' follow-up. Residents' self-reported changes in treating patients' tobacco use were substantiated through systematic chart review.CONCLUSION: The evidence-based Rx for Change in Psychiatry curriculum is offered as a model tobacco treatment curriculum that can be implemented in psychiatry residency training programs and disseminated widely, thereby effectively reaching a vulnerable and costly population of smokers.","Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0984, USA.

In 2005, an estimated 8.8% of Ontario's population had diabetes, representing more than 816,000 Ontarians. The direct health care cost of diabetes was $1.76 billion in the year 2000 and is projected to rise to a total cost of $3.14 billion by 2016. Much of this cost arises from the serious long-term complications associated with the disease including: coronary heart disease, stroke, adult blindness, limb amputations and kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of diabetes and while type 2 diabetes is more prevalent in people aged 40 years and older, prevalence in younger populations is increasing due to a rise in obesity and physical inactivity in children. Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) has shown that tight glycemic control can significantly reduce the risk of developing serious complications in type 2 diabetics. Despite physicians' and patients' knowledge of the importance of glycemic control, Canadian data has shown that only 38% of patients with diabetes have HbA1C levels in the optimal range of 7% or less. This statistic highlights the complexities involved in the management of diabetes, which is characterized by extensive patient involvement in addition to the support provided by physicians. An enormous demand is, therefore, placed on patients to self-manage the physical, emotional and psychological aspects of living with a chronic illness. Despite differences in individual needs to cope with diabetes, there is general agreement for the necessity of supportive programs for patient self-management. While traditional programs were didactic models with the goal of improving patients' knowledge of their disease, current models focus on behavioural approaches aimed at providing patients with the skills and strategies required to promote and change their behaviour. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated improved health outcomes with self-management support programs in type 2 diabetics. They have all, however, either looked at a specific component of self-management support programs (i.e. self-management education) or have been conducted in specific populations. Most reviews are also qualitative and do not clearly define the interventions of interest, making findings difficult to interpret. Moreover, heterogeneity in the interventions has led to conflicting evidence on the components of effective programs. There is thus much uncertainty regarding the optimal design and delivery of these programs by policymakers. EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS:RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Are behavioural interventions effective in improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes?Is the effectiveness of the intervention impacted by intervention characteristics (e.g. delivery of intervention, length of intervention, mode of instruction, interventionist etc.)?INCLUSION CRITERIA: English Language Published between January 1996 to August 2008 Type 2 diabetic adult population (&gt;18 years)Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)Systematic reviews, or meta-analyses Describing a multi-faceted self-management support intervention as defined by the 2007 Self-Management Mapping Guide (1)Reporting outcomes of glycemic control (HbA1c) with extractable data Studies with a minimum of 6-month follow upEXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies with a control group other than usual care Studies with a sample size &lt;30 Studies without a clearly defined interventionPRIMARY OUTCOME: glycemic control (HbA1c)SECONDARY OUTCOMES: systolic blood pressure (SBP) control, lipid control, change in smoking status, weight change, quality of life, knowledge, self-efficacy, managing psychosocial aspects of diabetes, assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to change, and setting and achieving diabetes goals.SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was performed in OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published between January 1996 and August 2008. Abstracts were reviewed by a single author and studies meeting the inclusion criteria outlined above were obtained. Data on population characteristics, glycemic control outcomes, and study design were extracted. Reference lists were also checked for relevant studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed as being either high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE methodology.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The search identified 638 citations published between 1996 and August 2008, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria and one was a meta-analysis (Gary et al. 2003). The remaining 11 studies were RCTs (9 were used in the meta-analysis) and only one was defined as small (total sample size N=47). SUMMARY OF PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS ACROSS STUDIES: A total of 2,549 participants were included in the 11 identified studies. The mean age of participants reported was approximately 58 years and the mean duration of diabetes was approximately 6 years. Most studies reported gender with a mean percentage of females of approximately 67%. Of the eleven studies, two focused only on women and four included only Hispanic individuals. All studies evaluated type 2 diabetes patients exclusively. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS: The studies were conducted between 2002 and 2008. Approximately six of 11 studies were carried out within the USA, with the remaining studies conducted in the UK, Sweden, and Israel (sample size ranged from 47 to 824 participants). The quality of the studies ranged from moderate to low with four of the studies being of moderate quality and the remaining seven of low quality (based on the Consort Checklist). Differences in quality were mainly due to methodological issues such as inadequate description of randomization, sample size calculation allocation concealment, blinding and uncertainty of the use of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Patients were recruited from several settings: six studies from primary or general medical practices, three studies from the community (e.g. via advertisements), and two from outpatient diabetes clinics. A usual care control group was reported in nine of 11 of the studies and two studies reported some type of minimal diabetes care in addition to usual care for the control group. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS: All of the interventions examined in the studies were mapped to the 2007 Self-management Mapping Guide. The interventions most often focused on problem solving, goal setting and encouraging participants to engage in activities that protect and promote health (e.g. modifying behaviour, change in diet, and increase physical activity). All of the studies examined comprehensive interventions targeted at least two self-care topics (e.g. diet, physical activity, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, etc.). Despite the homogeneity in the aims of the interventions, there was substantial clinical heterogeneity in other intervention characteristics such as duration, intensity, setting, mode of delivery (group vs. individual), interventionist, and outcomes of interest (discussed below). DURATION, INTENSITY AND MODE OF DELIVERY: Intervention durations ranged from 2 days to 1 year, with many falling into the range of 6 to 10 weeks. The rest of the interventions fell into categories of ≤ 2 weeks (2 studies), 6 months (2 studies), or 1 year (3 studies). Intensity of the interventions varied widely from 6 hours over 2 days, to 52 hours over 1 year; however, the majority consisted of interventions of 6 to 15 hours. Both individual and group sessions were used to deliver interventions. Group counselling was used in five studies as a mode of instruction, three studies used both individual and group sessions, and one study used individual sessions as its sole mode of instruction.

Specifically: Is the use of gFOBT or iFOBT associated with a reduction in CRC and overall mortality?What are the sensitivity and specificity of gFOBT and iFOBT for the detection of 1) CRC and 2) large polyps (≥ 1 cm)?CLINICAL NEED: CRC is the most common cause of non-tobacco related cancer death in Canada. It has been estimated that in 2007, 7,800 people were diagnosed with CRC in Ontario and 3,250 died from the disease, making the province's incidence and mortality rate of CRC amongst the highest in the world.THERAPY: THERE ARE TWO GENERAL TYPES OF FOBT THAT ARE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THE ANALYTE DETECTED: guaiac FOBT (gFOBT) and immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT). Blood in the stool is a nonspecific finding but may originate from CRC or larger (&gt;1 cm) polyps (small adenomatous polyps do not tend to bleed). Bleeding from cancers and larger polyps may be intermittent and not always detectable in a single sample. The FOBT thus requires regular testing that consists of collecting specimens from consecutive bowel movements. A positive gFOBT or iFOBT involves a diagnostic workup with colonoscopy to examine the entire colon in order to rule out the presence of cancer or advanced neoplasia. METHODS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted from January 2003 to June 2008 that included OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing &amp; Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination.INCLUSION CRITERIA: Patients at average risk for CRCAll patients must be at least 50 years of ageBiennial FOBT as a screening modality and use of colonoscopy as the reference standardSystematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs)OUTCOMES: CRC mortality, overall mortality, sensitivity, specificity, adverse effectsEXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies involving fewer than 100 patientsStudies that do not report sufficient data for analysis COMPARISONS OF INTEREST: Evidence exists for these comparisons of interest: gFOBT compared with the reference &quot;gold standard&quot; colonoscopy (or double-contrast barium enema where colonoscopy is incomplete or contraindicated)iFOBT compared with the reference gold standard colonoscopy (or DCBE where colonoscopy is incomplete or contraindicated)gFOBT compared with iFOBTThe quality of the diagnostic studies was examined according to the 'GRADE Working Group criteria' for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations for diagnostic tests and strategies.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: SINGLE-TEST STUDIES: There is limited direct/indirect evidence that iFOBT has sensitivity/specificity superior to that of unrehydrated gFOBT for CRC detection: sensitivity for gFOBT:13% and 25%pooled iFOBT sensitivity:81%There is evidence that iFOBT and gFOBT have lower sensitivities for adenoma detection than for CRC detection: sensitivity for rehydrated gFOBT22%pooled iFOBT sensitivity28% REPEATED-TEST STUDIES: No trials have examined CRC mortality outcomes after repeated testing of iFOBT.

228,,19101132,Foucault on methadone: beyond biopower.,"This essay reviews four texts which critically analyse methadone maintenance therapy using Foucault as a key theoretical framework: [Friedman, J., &amp; Alicea, M. (2001). Surviving heroin: Interviews with women in methadone clinics. Florida: University Press of Florida], [Bourgois, P. (2000). Disciplining addictions: The bio-politics of methadone and heroin in the United States. Culture Medicine and Psychiatry, 24, 165-195], [Bull, M. (2008). Governing the heroin trade: From treaties to treatment. Ashgate: Aldershot], and [Fraser, S., &amp; valentine, k. (2008). Substance &amp; substitution: Methadone subjects in liberal societies. New York: Palgrave Macmillan]. Taken together these works demonstrate one trajectory in the development of critical drug studies over the past decade. While all four view MMT as a regulatory technology which aims to create productive and obedient subjects, their understandings of the power relations of the clinic are quite distinct. The first two texts emphasise the social control of drug users, the third, issues of governmentality and liberal political practice, while the fourth engages with ontological questions about substances themselves. Thus while Foucauldian analysis has become familiar in social studies of drugs and alcohol, new uses for its conceptual tools continue to emerge.","School of Humanities, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia.

229,,19009140,"Vulnerability and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV patients, Minas Gerais State, Brazil.","The aim of the present study was to describe vulnerability profiles and to verify their association with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among 295 HIV-patients receiving their first prescription in two public-referral centers in Minas Gerais States, Brazil. The cumulative incidence of non-adherence was 36.9%. Three pure vulnerability profiles (lower, medium and higher) were identified based on the Grade of Membership method (GoM). Pure type patients of the &quot;higher vulnerability&quot; profile had, when compared to the overall sample, an increased probability of being younger, not understanding the need of ART, having a personal reason to be HIV-tested, not disclosing their HIV status, having more than one (non-regular) sexual partner, reporting use of alcohol, tobacco and illicit drugs, and having sex among men. Non-adherence to ART was statistically associated (p &lt; 0.001) with this profile. Also, the heterogeneity of the sample was found to be high, since over 40% were mixed type. The implications are that health staff should be trained to develop strategies for incorporating risk-reduction interventions, bearing in mind the three dimensions of vulnerability and the diversity of those patients initiating antiretroviral therapy.","Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brasil.",2008,S0102-311X2008001100015
230,,19001832,Preventing chronic disease risk factors: rationale and feasibility.,"SUMMARY OBJECTIVE: The majority of the mortality, morbidity, and disability in the United States and other developed countries is due to chronic diseases. These diseases could be prevented to a great extent with the elimination of four root causes: physical inactivity, poor nutrition, smoking, and hazardous drinking. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether efficacious risk factor prevention interventions exist and to examine the evidence that population-wide program implementation is justified.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature search for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials that tested interventions to increase physical activity, improve nutrition, reduce smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and reduce hazardous drinking.RESULTS: We found that appropriately designed interventions can produce behavioral change for the four behaviors. Effective interventions included tailored fact-to-face counseling, phone counseling, and computerized tailored feedback. Computer-based health behavior assessment with feedback and education was documented to be an effective method of determining behavior, assessing participant interest in behavior change and delivering interventions. Some programs have documented reduced health care costs associated with intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Positive results to date suggest that further investments to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of chronic disease risk factor prevention programs are warranted. Widespread implementation of these programs could have a significant impact on chronic disease incidence rates and costs of health care.","Department of Medicine, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.",2008,NA
231,,18996938,Alcohol consumption and alcohol counselling behaviour among US medical students: cohort study.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors affect alcohol counselling practices among medical students.DESIGN: Cohort study.SETTING: Nationally representative medical schools (n=16) in the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Medical students who graduated in 2003.INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires were completed (response rate 83%) at the start of students' first year (n=1846/2080), entrance to wards (typically during the third year of training) (n=1630/1982), and their final (fourth) year (n=1469/1901).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Previously validated questions on alcohol consumption and counselling.RESULTS: 78% (3777/4847) of medical students reported drinking in the past month, and a third (1668/ 4847) drank excessively; these proportions changed little over time. The proportion of those who believed alcohol counselling was highly relevant to care of patients was higher at entrance to wards (61%; 919/1516) than in final year students (46%; 606/1329). Although students intending to enter primary care were more likely to believe alcohol counselling was highly relevant, only 28% of final year students (391/1393) reported usually or always talking to their general medical patients about their alcohol consumption. Excessive drinkers were somewhat less likely than others to counsel patients or to think it relevant to do so. In multivariate models, extensive training in alcohol counselling doubled the frequency of reporting that alcohol counselling would be clinically relevant (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.3) and of reporting doing counselling (2.2, 1.5 to 3.3).CONCLUSIONS: Excessive drinking and binge drinking among US medical students is common, though somewhat less prevalent than among comparably aged adults in the US general population. Few students usually discussed alcohol use with patients, but greater training and confidence about alcohol counselling predicted both practising and believing in the relevance of alcohol counselling. Medical schools should consider routinely training students to screen and counsel patients for alcohol misuse and consider discouraging excessive drinking.","University of British Columbia, School of Population and Public Health, and Department of Family Practice, 5804 Fairview Avenue, Vancouver, BC, Canada. efrank@emory.edu",2008,10.1136/bmj.a2155

There were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate.CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the efficacy of topiramate in the relapse prevention of alcoholism. Suggestive evidence was also obtained for superiority of topiramate versus naltrexone, but this needs to be verified in future research with larger sample sizes.","Department of Psychiatry of the University of São Paulo, Brazil. dbaltieri@uol.com.br",2008,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02355.x
233,,18727823,Ultra-brief intervention for problem drinkers: research protocol.,"BACKGROUND: Helping the large number of problem drinkers who will never seek treatment is a challenging issue. Public health initiatives employing educational materials or mass media campaigns have met with mixed success. However, clinical research has developed effective brief interventions to help problem drinkers. This project will employ an intervention that has been validated in clinical settings and then modified into an ultra-brief format suitable for use as a public health intervention. The major objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to establish the effectiveness of an ultra-brief, personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers.DESIGN: Problem drinkers recruited on a baseline population telephone survey conducted in a major metropolitan city in Canada will be randomized to one of three conditions - a personalized feedback pamphlet condition, a control pamphlet condition, or a no intervention control condition. In the week after the baseline survey, households in the two pamphlet conditions will be sent their respective pamphlets. Changes in drinking will be assessed post intervention at three-month and six-month follow-ups. Drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental conditions using Structural Equation Modeling. The primary hypothesis is that problem drinkers from households who receive the personalized feedback pamphlet intervention will display significantly improved drinking outcomes at three and six-month follow-ups as compared to problem drinkers from households in the no intervention control condition. Secondary hypotheses will test the impact of the intervention on help seeking, and explore the mediating or moderating role of perceived drinking norms, perceived alcohol risks and the problem drinker's social reasons for drinking.DISCUSSION: This trial will provide information on the effectiveness of a pamphlet-based personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers in a community setting.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov registration #NCT00688584.","Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 33 Russell Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 2S1, Canada. john_cunningham@camh.net",2008,10.1186/1471-2458-8-298

Data were gathered at baseline, termination, 6 and 12 months post-termination. Analyses used latent growth curve modeling.SETTING: Community-based drug abuse clinic in the northeastern United States.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 224 youth, primarily male (81%), African American (72%), from low-income single-parent homes (58%) with an average age of 15 years were recruited into the study. All youth were drug users, with 75% meeting DSM-IV criteria for cannabis dependence and 13% meeting criteria for abuse.MEASUREMENTS: Five outcomes were measured: (i) substance use problem severity; (ii) 30-day frequency of cannabis use; (iii) 30-day frequency of alcohol use; (iv) 30-day frequency of other drug use; and (v) 30-day abstinence.FINDINGS: Both treatments produced significant decreases in cannabis consumption and slightly significant reductions in alcohol use, but there were no treatment differences in reducing frequency of cannabis and alcohol use. Significant treatment effects were found favoring MDFT on substance use problem severity, other drug use and minimal use (zero or one occasion of use) of all substances, and these effects continued to 12 months following treatment termination.CONCLUSION: Both interventions are promising treatments.

This study was conducted between July 2001 and June 2005. Participants (N = 196) ages 18-24 years (M = 20.8, SD = 2.0 years), who were recruited from a large city in the southeastern United States were randomized to brief office intervention or expressive writing plus brief office intervention. The sample was 56% female, 93% Caucasian, smoked a mean of 18.1 cigarettes per day (SD = 6.1), and had a mean body mass index of 24.9 (SD = 5.6). Participants who received the expressive writing plus brief office intervention gained significantly less weight than those receiving the brief office interventions from week 3 to 24, but did not significantly differ at week 52. A limitation of this investigation relates to the fact that the impact of expressive writing on weight was an unanticipated treatment effect that was evaluated in post-hoc analyses. Although the findings suggest that expressive writing holds promise as a treatment adjunct to decrease weight gain associated with smoking cessation, further research is warranted.","Division of Hematology and Oncology, Mayo Clinic, 4500 San Pablo Road, Jacksonville, FL 32224, USA. ames.steven@mayo.edu",2008,10.1080/10826080801922082

A new pharmacologic smoking cessation aid, varenicline, is now available in Canada. Level I evidence at 1-year follow-up indicates that it is effective for smoking cessation. Adverse effects include nausea, insomnia, and abnormal dreaming. Nausea is mild or moderate and decreases over time. Varenicline is more effective than placebo or bupropion. Counseling also increases the likelihood of achieving cessation.CONCLUSION: Preliminary data indicate that varenicline is more effective than other available pharmacologic smoking cessation aids. Pharmacologic therapy should be combined with nonpharmacologic therapy.","Queen's University, Family Medicine, 220 Bagot St, PO Bag 8888, Kingston, ON K7L 5E9. jay.schmelzle@queensu.ca",2008,NA

Participants were adolescent smokers (34 females, 35 males) with a mean +/- SD age of 15.8 +/- 1.4 years; 86% were Caucasian, who were randomly assigned to receive the BOI as part of a larger clinical trial. They were recruited from three cities in the Midwest and Northeastern part of the United States. After the baseline assessment, the BOI was designed for adolescents to receive four weekly individual sessions with a research counselor lasting between 10 and 40 min each. The BOI includes motivational interviewing and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Readiness to quit was assessed at each treatment session using the stages of change algorithm. The validated Adolescent Smoking Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) was used to assess self-efficacy at baseline (week 0) prior to the intervention and at post-treatment (week 4). The SES items comprise three factors or subscales: opportunities to smoke, emotional stress, and friends' influence.RESULTS: The percentage of adolescents who made improvement on readiness to quit from the baseline treatment session was statistically significant (p &lt; .001) for each of the three subsequent treatment sessions. Self-efficacy scores increased significantly (p &lt; .004) from baseline to post-treatment for all three subscales.CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents receiving a BOI progressed in their readiness and self-efficacy to quit. Understanding the change process among adolescent smokers during treatment could influence the design of future stop smoking interventions.","Department of Psychiatry and Psychology and the Behavioral Health Research Program, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA. patten.christi@mayo.edu",2008,10.1080/13548500701426703
238,,18528958,Canadian consensus practice guidelines for bisphosphonate associated osteonecrosis of the jaw.,"OBJECTIVE: Following publication of the first reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in patients receiving bisphosphonates in 2003, a call for national multidisciplinary guidelines based upon a systematic review of the current evidence was made by the Canadian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (CAOMS) in association with national and international societies concerned with ONJ. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide recommendations regarding diagnosis, identification of at-risk patients, and prevention and management strategies, based on current evidence and consensus. These guidelines were developed for medical and dental practitioners as well as for oral pathologists and related specialists.METHODS: The multidisciplinary task force established by the CAOMS reviewed all relevant areas of research relating to ONJ associated with bisphosphonate use and completed a systematic review of current literature. These evidence-based guidelines were developed utilizing a structured development methodology. A modified Delphi consensus process enabled consensus among the multidisciplinary task force members. These guidelines have since been reviewed by external experts and endorsed by national and international medical, dental, oral surgery, and oral pathology societies.RESULTS: RECOMMENDATIONS regarding diagnosis, prevention, and management of ONJ were made following analysis of all current data pertaining to this condition. ONJ has many etiologic factors including head and neck irradiation, trauma, periodontal disease, local malignancy, chemotherapy, and glucocorticoid therapy. High-dose intravenous bisphosphonates have been identified as a risk factor for ONJ in the oncology patient population. Low-dose bisphosphonate use in patients with osteoporosis or other metabolic bone disease has not been causally linked to the development of ONJ. Prevention, staging, and treatment recommendations are based upon collective expert opinion and current data, which has been limited to case reports, case series, surveys, retrospective studies, and 2 prospective observational studies.RECOMMENDATIONS: In all oncology patients, a thorough dental examination including radiographs should be completed prior to the initiation of intravenous bisphosphonate therapy. In this population, any invasive dental procedure is ideally completed prior to the initiation of high-dose bisphosphonate therapy. Non-urgent procedures are preferably delayed for 3 to 6 months following interruption of bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis patients receiving oral or intravenous bisphosphonates do not require a dental examination prior to initiating therapy in the presence of appropriate dental care and good oral hygiene. Stopping smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining good oral hygiene should be emphasized for all patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Individuals with established ONJ are most appropriately managed with supportive care including pain control, treatment of secondary infection, removal of necrotic debris, and mobile sequestrate. Aggressive debridement is contraindicated.CONCLUSION: Our multidisciplinary guidelines, which provide a rational evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, prevention, and management of bisphosphonate-associated ONJ in Canada, are based on the best available published data and the opinion of national and international experts involved in the prevention and management of ONJ.","Divisions of Endocrinology and Geriatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.",2008,NA

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the American College of Emergency Physician's brief alcohol use intervention brochure on patients' hazardous drinking behavior and knowledge of safe alcohol use. We conducted a controlled trial comparing Emergency Department (ED) subjects receiving the alcohol use intervention brochure vs. receiving no brochure. One-month outcome measures included the following: 1) change in days of hazardous drinking; 2) change in knowledge of safe alcohol use; and 3) movement along a readiness-to-change continuum for excessive alcohol use. Of 277 subjects, 252 (91.0%) agreed to participate, and 188 of these (74.6%) were successfully contacted for 1-month follow-up assessment. We did not find any significant decreases in days of hazardous drinking or increases in knowledge of safe drinking limits for either the intervention or comparison groups. However, among the subgroup of excessive alcohol users (n = 100), we found that significantly more intervention subjects had advanced along the readiness-to-change continuum than comparison subjects (p &lt; 0.01). This effect was even greater among the intervention group subjects who stated that they read the brochure (p &lt; 0.001). A brief alcohol use intervention brochure does not affect ED patients' hazardous drinking behavior or knowledge of safe alcohol use. The brochure, however, may affect certain patients' motivation to change their drinking behavior. Changing drinking behavior requires more than simply handing out a brochure in the ED; referral to community resources for those motivated to change is likely an important component to successful management of this problem.","Department of Emergency Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA.",2008,10.1016/j.jemermed.2008.03.003

Before randomization, eligible women who reported previous sexual activity were interviewed and tested for Ct DNA by Hybrid Capture 2 and polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping. Multivariate models were developed.RESULTS: Overall prevalence was 14.2% (95% confidence interval, 13.3-15.1). Among Ct genotypes, serovar E was the most common (4.3%), followed by serovar F (3.0%), serovar D/Da (2.9%), and serovar I/Ia (2.1%).Ct increased with lifetime sexual partners of the women, and among women with 1 lifetime partner, with sexual partners of the partner. Current intrauterine device users had an increase in Ct detection [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 1.1-2.5] but hormonal contraceptives or condom users did not. Miscarriages were associated with a reduction in Ct detection (OR 0.7, 0.5-1.0) while current regular smoking increased it (OR 1.7, 1.2-2.5). Vaginal discharge, reactive changes, ASCUS or LSIL and moderate to severe inflammation in the cytology were significantly more common among Ct positive women (P &lt;0.001). Gonorrhea prevalence was 0.8%, and it was, as other STIs, highly correlated with Ct detection.CONCLUSIONS: This is a high-prevalence population where we confirmed the strong link between Ct and sexual behavior of women and their partners. The establishment of a screening program in the age group included in this study should be considered. More studies are needed in developing countries to further investigate the role of intrauterine devices and the lack of protection by condoms, in addition to the interplay between Ct and other STIs, ectopy, inflammation, and epithelial abnormalities.","Proyecto Epidemiológico Guanacaste, Fundación INCIENSA, San José, Costa Rica. cporras@proyectoguanacaste.org",2008,10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181644b4c
241,,18433044,"A randomized, controlled trial of smoking cessation counseling provided during child hospitalization for respiratory illness.","The impact of parental smoking on children is enormous. Injury and illness related to parental smoking result in 6,200 excess pediatric deaths per year, which places smoking as the leading preventable cause of death in US children. Parental smoking doubles the risk of child hospitalization for respiratory illness therefore pediatricians have frequent contact with smoking parents. A single study has previously investigated the effect of child hospitalization on parental smoking cessation. Smoking caregivers of children hospitalized for respiratory illness at the University of New Mexico were offered a smoking cessation intervention during the child's hospitalization. Participants were randomized to receive either a brief anti-smoking message or more extensive counseling based on current clinical practice guidelines. Forty-two parents enrolled in the study. Fourteen percent of participants in the counseling group and 5% in the brief message group were self-reported quitters at 6 months. A significant percentage of smoking parents of children hospitalized for respiratory illness are willing to receive smoking cessation counseling while their child is in the hospital. Abstinence rates appear similar to other pediatric office-based interventions. Child hospitalization should be considered an important opportunity to provide parents with smoking cessation services, particularly since many smoking parents will not have access to these services elsewhere.","Department of Pediatrics, Community Medical Center, 2827 Fort Missoula Road, Missoula, MT 59804, USA. sralston@communitymed.org",2008,10.1002/ppul.20810
242,,18422825,Alcohol screening and brief counseling in a primary care hypertensive population: a quality improvement intervention.,"AIMS: To determine the effect of an intervention to improve alcohol screening and brief counseling for hypertensive patients in primary care.DESIGN: Two-year randomized, controlled trial.PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one primary care practices across the United States with a common electronic medical record.INTERVENTION: To promote alcohol screening and brief counseling. Intervention practices received site visits from study personnel and were invited to annual network meetings to review the progress of the project and share improvement strategies.MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures included rates of documented alcohol screening in hypertensive patients and brief counseling administered in those diagnosed with high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Secondary outcomes included change in blood pressure among patients with these diagnoses.FINDINGS: Hypertensive patients in intervention practices were significantly more likely to have been screened after 2 years than hypertensive patients in control practices [64.5% versus 23.5%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 8.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-38.2; P &lt; 0.0087]. Patients in intervention practices diagnosed with high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence were more likely than those in control practices to have had alcohol counseling documented (50.5% versus 29.6%; adjusted OR = 5.5, 95% CI 1.3-23.3). Systolic (adjusted mean decline = 4.2 mmHg, P = 0.036) and diastolic (adjusted mean decline = 3.3 mmHg, P = 0.006) blood pressure decreased significantly among hypertensive patients receiving alcohol counseling.CONCLUSIONS: Primary care practices receiving an alcohol-focused intervention over 2 years improved rates of alcohol screening for their hypertensive population. Implementation of alcohol counseling for high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence also improved and led to changes in patient blood pressures.","Department of Family Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. liszkah@musc.edu",2008,10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02199.x

A high percentage of smokers attempt to quit each year; however, smoking cessation success rates are low. Adding an exercise program to traditional therapies can increase smoking cessation rates among women. An experimental design was used to test two hypotheses. The first was that women who engage in a multifaceted approach to smoking cessation that includes a structured exercise program, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and weekly counseling sessions will experience less weight gain during an 8-week smoking cessation program and at the 4-month follow-up session than women who engage in NRT and weekly counseling sessions alone. The second was that women who engage in a structured exercise program with NRT and weekly counseling sessions will have higher smoking cessation rates at the end of the 8-week smoking cessation program and at the 4-month follow-up session than women who engage in NRT and weekly counseling sessions alone.","Texas Woman's University, Dallas, TX, USA.",2008,NA

The purpose of the present article from the Canadian Thoracic Society is to provide up-to-date information so that patients with this condition receive optimal care that is firmly based on scientific evidence. Important summary messages for clinicians are derived from the more detailed Update publication and are highlighted throughout the document. Three key messages contained in the update are: use targeted screening spirometry to establish a diagnosis and initiate prompt management (including smoking cessation) of mild COPD; improve dyspnea and activity limitation in stable COPD using new evidence-based treatment algorithms; and understand the importance of preventing and managing acute exacerbations, particularly in moderate to severe disease.","Queen's University, Kingston, Canada. odonnell@queensu.ca",2008,NA

A non-probabilistic sample of volunteers was selected consecutively on the days respondents appeared for their appointments at the clinics. Personal data and information on sexual behavior, drug use and knowledge of hepatitis was collected through interviews. Tests were conducted to detect infections of the hepatitis B and C viruses.RESULTS: Out of the interviewees, 81% were men and 19% women, with an average age of 39 (SD=6.1) and six years of formal education (SD=2.0). There was no difference in marital status between the sexes, of which 48% were single, 42% were married, and 8% were divorced. The average ages for first use of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs were 13, 15 and 18, respectively. Hepatitis B and C prevalence were 55% (95% CI: 49;63) and 83%(95% CI: 78;88), respectively. Eighty percent of respondents had not heard of Hepatitis B and C prior to the first time they used injecting drugs.CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence rates of Hepatitis B and C and low level of knowledge regarding the diseases justify the inclusion of information about hepatitis infections and the hepatitis B vaccines in HIV harm reduction strategies.","Centro de Referência de DST/AIDS Nossa Senhora do O, Secretaria Municipal de Saúde, São Paulo, SP, Brasil. angela.marchesini@terra.com.br",2008,NA
246,,18367988,Prevalence of fetal ethanol exposure in a regional population-based sample by meconium analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters.,"Challenges in identifying children exposed prenatally to ethanol necessitate the development of a biomarker for neonates at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), products of nonoxidative ethanol metabolism, have been established as a novel biomarker of fetal ethanol exposure. We present the first application of this biomarker to a population-based sample in Canada. Six-hundred eighty-two meconium specimens were anonymously collected in the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario, Canada. Meconium FAEE were extracted by liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction and analyzed by gas chromatography with flame-ionization detection confirmed by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. We measured ethyl palmitate (E16:0), ethyl palmitoleate (E16:1), ethyl stearate (E18:0), ethyl oleate (E18:1), ethyl linoleate (E18:2), ethyl linolenate (E18:3), and ethyl arachidonate (E20:4). Seventeen of 682 meconium samples tested positive for significant prenatal ethanol exposure (&gt;2.0 nmol/g). FAEE analysis detected fivefold more ethanol-exposed pregnancies than standard postpartum questionnaires in this population (2.5% versus 0.5%) (P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of ethanol-exposed pregnancies was consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of &quot;frequent&quot; prenatal drinking and previously published estimates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder disease prevalence in the general North American population. The FAEE concentrations of negative (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.49 nmol/g) versus positive (95% confidence interval, 7.74-151.28 nmol/g) samples were distinct, further demonstrating the specificity of this biomarker in determining significant prenatal ethanol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis demonstrates a fivefold increase in sensitivity over currently used methods of self-report-based screening in Ontario for the detection of ethanol-exposed pregnancies in a clinical setting.","Motherisk Program, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.",2008,10.1097/FTD.0b013e318167cfe5

Students who had undergone the Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College Students (BASICS) (N = 145 at baseline; 142 at 12 months, and 103 at 24 months, loss of 29.7%) were compared with a control group (N = 121 at baseline; 121 at 12 months and 113 at 24 months, loss of 9.3%), the nonintervention group. Variables included drinking frequency, quantity and peak consumption, dependence assessment, and family and friends' abuse assessment.RESULTS: Treated students at a 24-month follow-up decreased quantity of alcohol use per occasion and lowered AUDIT and RAPI scores.CONCLUSIONS: This is the first brief intervention work on risky drinking with college students in Brazil and the results are encouraging. However, it is difficult to conduct individual prevention strategies in a country where culture fosters heavy drinking through poor public policy on alcohol and lack of law enforcement.","Department of Neurology, Psychology and Psychiatry, Botucatu Medical School, São Paulo State University (UNESP), Brazil.",2008,10.1093/alcalc/agn019
248,,18340389,Changes in lifestyle after hypertension diagnosis in Canada.,"Lifestyle modification should be an important part of therapy when hypertension is first diagnosed, with or without starting antihypertensive medication. The objective of the present study was to determine the extent to which recently diagnosed hypertensive Canadians modify their lifestyles and to examine how lifestyle modification relates to antihypertensive medication use. The longitudinal National Population Health Survey in Canada was conducted between 1994 and 2002, including five interview cycles at two-year intervals. During this time, 1281 persons reported hypertension in one cycle but not in the previous cycle, and were considered to be new hypertensive patients. Information collected included body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and medication use. The main lifestyle modification associated with newly diagnosed hypertensive patients was smoking cessation, with a 18.6% relative risk reduction (RRR). A smaller change was seen in decreasing physical inactivity (RRR 6.2%). Persons not taking antihypertensive medication were not more likely to make lifestyle improvements. Paradoxically, new hypertensive patients showed increased numbers in the obese category (RRR -9.6%). Weight gain was especially marked among antihypertensive medication users and largest in female beta-blocker users (RRR -36.6%). If confirmed, this needs to be considered when prescribing to overweight people. In general, a greater effort is required to manage hypertension by lifestyle risk modification with or without antihypertensive medication.","Centre of Chronic Disease Prevention and Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. ineke_neutel@phac-aspc.gc.ca",2008,NA
249,,18316746,Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using spirometry: summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Fewer than half of the estimated 24 million Americans with airflow obstruction have received a COPD diagnosis, and diagnosis often occurs in advanced stages of the disease.PURPOSE: To summarize the evidence on screening for COPD using spirometry for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).DATA SOURCES: English-language articles identified in PubMed and the Cochrane Library through January 2007, recent systematic reviews, expert suggestions, and reference lists of retrieved articles.STUDY SELECTION: Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for each of the 8 key questions on benefits and harms of screening. Eligible study types varied by question.DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria.DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmacologic treatments for COPD reduce acute exacerbations in patients with severe disease. However, severe COPD is uncommon in the general U.S. population. Spirometry has not been shown to independently increase smoking cessation rates. Potential harms from screening include false-positive results and adverse effects from subsequent unnecessary therapy. Data on the prevalence of airflow obstruction in the U.S. population were used to calculate projected outcomes from screening groups defined by age and smoking status.LIMITATION: No studies provide direct evidence on health outcomes associated with screening for COPD.CONCLUSION: Screening for COPD using spirometry is likely to identify a predominance of patients with mild to moderate airflow obstruction who would not experience additional health benefits if labeled as having COPD. Hundreds of patients would need to undergo spirometry to defer a single exacerbation.","Center for Primary Care, Prevention, and Clinical Partnerships, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, Maryland 20850, USA. kenneth.lin@ahrq.hhs.gov",2008,NA

Hospitals should also consider beta-blocker therapy at discharge for stabilized patients without contraindications.CONCLUSION: The 5 Million Lives Campaign's focus on delivering reliable, evidence-based care for patients with CHF is part of an overall strategy to reduce medically induced harm.","Institute for Healthcare Improvement, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. djacobsen@ihi.org",2008,NA
251,,18237661,"Alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral in the emergency department: an implementation study.","INTRODUCTION: Alcohol is the single greatest contributor to injury in the United States. Numerous studies have reported that a standardized screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) intervention can effectively minimize future alcohol consumption, reduce injury recurrence, and decrease the number of repeat ED visits. To date, SBIRT studies have been conducted in settings in which physicians or research assistants carried out SBIRT. Little is known about ED nurses carrying out SBIRT. The purpose of this study was to examine ED nurse training needs and identify both barriers to, and enablers of, SBIRT implementation in the emergency department.METHODS: Two coordinators from each of the 5 ED sites selected for the study attended a 1-day SBIRT educational session. Site coordinators then trained their staff nurses to conduct SBIRT. Site coordinators were surveyed at the midpoint and end of the 6-month implementation study period. Patient data from each facility was collected.RESULTS: Ten site coordinators were trained and held subsequent training sessions with nursing staff in their respective emergency departments. All sites encountered barriers to implementation, but 2 of 5 sites were able to implement the SBIRT process fully by the end of the evaluation period. A total of 3265 patients were screened for alcohol use problems. Of those screened, 678 (21%) were classified as hazardous drinkers. Overall, 56% of the positive-screened patients received 3 to 5 minutes of a brief intervention. After the brief intervention, between 9% and 82% of patients were referred for further care.DISCUSSION: The SBIRT process can be conducted successfully by emergency nurses. However, substantial operational barriers to widespread routine implementation exist. These barriers need to be addressed before emergency nurses incorporate SBIRT as routine part of ED care.","ENA Injury Prevention Institute/EN CARE, Emergency Nurses Association, Des Plaines, Ill 60016-6569, USA. pdesy@ena.org",2008,10.1016/j.jen.2007.03.019

They received 16 weeks of naltrexone (Revia) or acamprosate (Campral) or both medications and/or placebos in combination with medical management (MM), with or without combined behavioral intervention (CBI); one group received CBI without pills or MM. Drinking behavior and clinical status were assessed at the end of treatment (Week 16) and at Weeks 26, 52, and 68.RESULTS: Prior treatment with active naltrexone, without active acamprosate or CBI or with active acamprosate plus CBI, and CBI with double placebo resulted in a significantly higher percentage of days abstinent than double placebos with no CBI (p &lt; .05). Having received CBI was associated with positive clinical response posttreatment, compared with not having received CBI. Prior treatment with naltrexone increased the time to the first heavy-drinking day posttreatment (p = .03). No differences were found between patients who had received CBI without MM or pills and those having received MM and double placebo with or without CBI. No significant main effects for acamprosate were found on any of the outcome measures.CONCLUSIONS: Previous treatment with MM and either CBI or naltrexone, or both, but not acamprosate, was associated with sustained efficacy beyond discontinuation. Reasons for the maintained treatment gains with naltrexone and/or CBI and potential methods to extend them are discussed.","Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute, 1107 NE 45th Street, Suite 120, Seattle, Washington 98105-4631, USA. ddonovan@u.washington.edu",2007,NA
253,,18071970,Unhealthy behaviours for self-management of HIV-related peripheral neuropathy.,"The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy is frequent in HIV disease and is often associated with antiretroviral therapy. Unhealthy behaviours, particularly substance-use behaviours, are utilized by many HIV-positive individuals to manage neuropathic symptoms. As part of a larger study on self-care for symptoms in HIV disease, this study analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of unhealthy behaviours to self-manage peripheral neuropathy in HIV disease. Sociodemographic and disease-related correlates and unhealthy behaviours were examined in a convenience sample of 1,217 respondents who were recruited from data collection sites in several US cities, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Taiwan. Results of the study indicated that respondents with peripheral neuropathy (n=450) identified a variety of unhealthy self-care behaviours including injection drug use, oral drug use, smoking cigarettes and alcohol ingestion. Specific unhealthy behaviours that participants reported to alleviate peripheral neuropathy included use of marijuana (n=67), smoking cigarettes (n=139), drinking alcohol (n=81) and street drugs (n=30). A subset of those individuals (n=160), who identified high levels of neuropathy (greater than five on a scale of 1-10), indicated significantly higher use of amphetamines and injection drug use in addition to alcohol use and cigarette smoking. For participants from Norway, substance use (using alcohol: 56%) was one of the most frequent self-management strategies. Implications for clinical practice include assessment and education of persons with HIV for self-care management of the complex symptom of peripheral neuropathy.","Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. pnicholas@mghihp.edu",2007,NA

Patterns of association of cocaine dependence with background characteristics were not appreciably different when the gated and ungated approaches were applied.CONCLUSIONS: In panoramic mental health surveys, the inefficiency of an ungated approach must be balanced against the anticipated number of cases of dependence without associated social role impairments or harm. In this study, the reduction in the number of identified cocaine dependence cases appeared to be so small that even in a sample of over 40,000 participants, attenuation in population prevalence would prove difficult to detect.","Department of Epidemiology, Michigan State University, B601 West Fee Hall, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. l.degenhardt@unsw.edu.au",2007,NA

However, most screening studies have been conducted in Europe and Australia, where attendance for screening was higher than the single large U.S. study involving only veterans. The prevalence of AAA in the U.S. general population is not well defined, nor is the best method of recruitment for screening. Letters of invitation for a free screening ultrasound for AAA were sent to 30,000 randomly selected Medicare beneficiaries from the hospital referral region of three university-affiliated hospitals without restriction by age, gender, or comorbidity. Attendance for screening was calculated by age, gender, and travel distance to the screening center. Telephone calls to a random sample of nonresponders were made to determine the reason for failure to attend. Prevalence of AAA by ultrasound and known risk factors for AAA (e.g., age, gender, smoking status) were determined. The attendance rate was 7% (2,005). Attendance was greater with male gender (p &lt; 0.01), younger age (p &lt; 0.05), and decreased travel distance to the screening center (p &lt; 0.05). The primary reasons for failure to attend included incorrect address or vital status, poor health, and lack of interest. Prevalence of previously undetected AAA was 2.8% in men and 0.2% in women. AAA was predicted by smoking status and male gender (p &lt; 0.01 for each). Unselected invitation of Medicare beneficiaries for ultrasound screening for AAA results in a low attendance and low yield of AAA. The prevalence estimates from this study may not reflect the entire Medicare population given the low attendance and may reflect the healthy habits of those most interested in screening. Patients should be selected for screening based on their suitability for repair if an AAA is found as well as their risk factors for AAA. The best method of recruitment for screening of those most at risk for AAA in the United States remains to be determined.","Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. mscherm@bidmc.harvard.edu",2007,NA

OPTION: Supplementation with folic acid and vitamins is problematic, since 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, and women's health status may not be optimal when they conceive.OUTCOMES: Folic acid in combination with a multivitamin supplement has been associated with a decrease in specific birth defects.EVIDENCE: Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Database were searched for relevant English language articles published between 1985 and 2007. The previous Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) Policy Statement of November 1993 and statements from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Canadian College of Medical Geneticists were also reviewed in developing this clinical practice guideline.VALUES: The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Promoting the use of folic acid and a multivitamin supplement among women of reproductive age will reduce the incidence of birth defects. The costs are those of daily vitamin supplementation and eating a healthy diet.RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Women in the reproductive age group should be advised about the benefits of folic acid in addition to a multivitamin supplement during wellness visits (birth control renewal, Pap testing, yearly examination) especially if pregnancy is contemplated. (III-A) 2. Women should be advised to maintain a healthy diet, as recommended in Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide (Health Canada). Foods containing excellent to good sources of folic acid are fortified grains, spinach, lentils, chick peas, asparagus, broccoli, peas, Brussels sprouts, corn, and oranges. However, it is unlikely that diet alone can provide levels similar to folate-multivitamin supplementation. (III-A) 3. Women taking a multivitamin containing folic acid should be advised not to take more than one daily dose of vitamin supplement, as indicated on the product label. (II-2-A) 4. Folic acid and multivitamin supplements should be widely available without financial or other barriers for women planning pregnancy to ensure the extra level of supplementation. (III-B) 5. Folic acid 5 mg supplementation will not mask vitamin B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia), and investigations (examination or laboratory) are not required prior to initiating supplementation. (II-2-A) 6. The recommended strategy to prevent recurrence of a congenital anomaly (anencephaly, myelomeningocele, meningocele, oral facial cleft, structural heart disease, limb defect, urinary tract anomaly, hydrocephalus) that has been reported to have a decreased incidence following preconception / first trimester folic acid +/- multivitamin oral supplementation is planned pregnancy +/- supplementation compliance. A folate-supplemented diet with additional daily supplementation of multivitamins with 5 mg folic acid should begin at least three months before conception and continue until 10 to 12 weeks post conception. From 12 weeks post-conception and continuing throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period (4-6 weeks or as long as breastfeeding continues), supplementation should consist of a multivitamin with folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg). (I-A) 7. The recommended strategy(ies) for primary prevention or to decrease the incidence of fetal congenital anomalies will include a number of options or treatment approaches depending on patient age, ethnicity, compliance, and genetic congenital anomaly risk status. OPTION A: Patients with no personal health risks, planned pregnancy, and good compliance require a good diet of folate-rich foods and daily supplementation with a multivitamin with folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg) for at least two to three months before conception and throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period (4-6 weeks and as long as breastfeeding continues). (II-2-A) OPTION B: Patients with health risks, including epilepsy, insulin dependent diabetes, obesity with BMI &gt;35 kg/m2, family history of neural tube defect, belonging to a high-risk ethnic group (e.g., Sikh) require increased dietary intake of folate-rich foods and daily supplementation, with multivitamins with 5 mg folic acid, beginning at least three months before conception and continuing until 10 to 12 weeks post conception. From 12 weeks post-conception and continuing throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period (4-6 weeks or as long as breastfeeding continues), supplementation should consist of a multivitamin with folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg). (II-2-A) OPTION C: Patients who have a history of poor compliance with medications and additional lifestyle issues of variable diet, no consistent birth control, and possible teratogenic substance use (alcohol, tobacco, recreational non-prescription drugs) require counselling about the prevention of birth defects and health problems with folic acid and multivitamin supplementation. The higher dose folic acid strategy (5 mg) with multivitamin should be used, as it may obtain a more adequate serum red blood cell folate level with irregular vitamin / folic acid intake but with a minimal additional health risk. (III-B) 8.

258,,18048639,Tobacco cessation quitlines in North America: a descriptive study.,"BACKGROUND: Quitlines have become an integral part of tobacco control efforts in the United States and Canada. The demonstrated efficacy and the convenience of telephone based counselling have led to the fast adoption of quitlines, to the point of near universal access in North America. However, information on how these quitlines operate in actual practice is not often readily available.OBJECTIVES: This study describes quitline practice in North America and examines commonalities and differences across quitlines. It will serve as a source of reference for practitioners and researchers, with the aim of furthering service quality and promoting continued innovation.DESIGN: A self administered questionnaire survey of large, publicly funded quitlines in the United States and Canada. A total of 52 US quitlines and 10 Canadian quitlines participated. Descriptive statistics are provided regarding quitline operational structures, clinical services, quality assurance procedures, funding sources and utilisation rates.RESULTS: Clinical services for the 62 state/provincial quitlines are supplied by a total of 26 service providers. Nine providers operate multiple quitlines, creating greater consistency in operation than would otherwise be expected. Most quitlines offer services over extended hours (mean 96 hours/week) and have multiple language capabilities. Most (98%) use proactive multisession counselling-a key feature of protocols tested in previous experimental trials. Almost all quitlines have extensive training programmes (&gt;60 hours) for counselling staff, and over 70% conduct regular evaluation of outcomes. About half of quitlines use the internet to provide cessation information. A little over a third of US quitlines distribute free cessation medications to eligible callers. The average utilisation rate of the US state quitlines in the 2004-5 fiscal year was about 1.0% across states, with a strong correlation between the funding level of the quitlines and the smokers' utilisation of them (r = 0.74, p&lt;0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Quitlines in North America display core commonalities: they have adopted the principles of multisession proactive counselling and they conduct regular outcome evaluation. Yet variations, tested and untested, exist. Standardised reporting procedures would be of benefit to the field. Shared discussion of the rationale behind variations can inform future decision making for all North American quitlines.","University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093-0905, USA.",2007,NA
259,,18006240,Evaluation of smoking cessation behaviors and interventions among Latino smokers at low-income clinics in a US-Mexico border county.,"A descriptive study of 94 Latino smokers receiving nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in US-Mexico border clinics in El Paso County, Texas was conducted. A baseline questionnaire and two follow-up telephone surveys (8-12 weeks and 6 months) were administered to evaluate smoking habits, behaviors, and cessation interventions. Participants reported an average daily cigarette consumption of 15 cigarettes and smoked within 30 min of waking (44%). Primary motivations for quitting were personal health (95%), family's health (74%), and doctor's advice (71%). Female smokers were more likely to smoke due to being anxious (p=0.012), not being able to sleep (p=0.02), or to feel thin (p=0.002). Male smokers were more likely to smoke when drinking alcohol (p=0.005). Nearly 40% of smokers reported they had never tried to quit before. Medication use at baseline was 82% patch, 53% lozenge, 29% gum, and 24% bupropion (combination therapy permitted). At 8-12 weeks, nearly two-thirds of patients were quit and 44% remained quit at six months. Smoking habits, behaviors, and successful cessation interventions among Latinos in a US-Mexico border community were identified.","University of Texas, El Paso, Texas, USA. jjsias@utep.edu",2007,NA
260,,17979140,A multicenter study of major depressive disorder among emergency department patients in Latin-American countries.,"This multicenter study estimated the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among emergency department patients in Latin America. To identify patients with MDD, we used a combination of DSM IV- criteria interview and a questionnaire screen including the center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. We analyzed data from consecutive adult patients from hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico and described the demographic and health status differences between MDD and non-MDD patients. Prevalence of MDD ranges from 23.0 to 35.0%. The estimates are based on a total of 1,835 patients aged 18 years and over, with response rates of 83.0%. Compared to non-MDD patients, MDD patients were more likely to be middle-aged, female, smokers, of lower socioeconomic status, and to report a diagnosis of asthma or arthritis/rheumatism. Multivariate analysis identified a lower level of education, smoking, and self-reported anxiety, chronic fatigue, and back problems to be independently associated with MDD. Our data suggest that the prevalence of MDD is elevated among emergency department patients in Latin American countries. The integration of depression screening into routine emergency care merits serious consideration, especially if such screening can be linked to psychiatric treatment.","Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA.",2007,NA
261,,17880340,The search for mechanisms of behavior change in evidence-based behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorders: overview.,"BACKGROUND: Over the past three decades, the main question of interest to alcohol treatment researchers has concerned the main effects of a particular behavioral intervention or what works. Increasingly, alcohol treatment researchers are turning their attention to the underlying psychological, social, and even neurophysiologic processes or &quot;active ingredients&quot; that are driving therapeutic change.METHOD: The articles contained in this supplement to Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research grew out of invited presentations given at a one-day satellite session immediately preceding the 28th Annual Meeting of the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA). The conference was a collaborative effort of the Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addiction at the University of New Mexico, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, Brown University, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health.RESULTS: The conference featured a mix of full-length presentations on conceptual and methodological issues, reports of original research findings, and lively discussion among speakers and conference participants. Understanding mechanisms of behavior change will benefit the field by identifying the key aspects of therapy that must be present for maximum effect, irrespective of the specific technique being applied; provide a new way to approach patient-treatment interactions; and lay the groundwork for understanding how change is affected by social and other extratreatment factors.CONCLUSIONS: Although not a new topic to the field, understanding mechanisms of behavior change has begun to capture the interest of an increasing number of alcohol treatment researchers. Understanding behavior change is an exceedingly complex enterprise and innovative thinking and creative research designs will be required to advance the field.","National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health, 5635 Fishers Lane, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. bhuebner@niaaa.nih.gov",2007,NA

Published literature contains little systematic empirical analysis of the interaction between organizational characteristics and treatment outcomes. This paper addresses that deficit. It develops and tests a hierarchical linear model (HLM) to address questions about the empirical relationship between treatment inputs (industry costs, types and use of counseling and medical personnel, diagnosis mix, patient demographics, and the nature and level of services used in substance abuse treatment), and patient outcomes (retention and treatment completion rates). The paper adds to the literature by demonstrating a direct and statistically significant link between treatment completion and the organizational and staffing structure of the treatment setting. Related reimbursement issues, questions for future analysis, and limitations of the ADSS for this analysis are discussed.","Department of Research &amp; Development, American College of Cardiology, 2400 N St. NW, Washington, DC, 20037, USA.",2007,NA
263,,17885300,Trends in perimortal conditions and mortality rates among HIV-infected patients.,"OBJECTIVES: To describe trends in perimortal conditions (pathological conditions causing death or present at death but not necessarily the reported cause of death) during three periods related to the availability of HAART, pre-HAART (1992-1995), early HAART (1996-1999), and contemporary HAART (2000-2003); annual mortality rates; and antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevalence during 1992-2003.DESIGN: Multicenter observational clinical cohort in the United States (Adult/Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease [ASD] project).METHODS: Proportionate mortality for selected perimortal conditions, annual mortality rates, and ART prevalence were standardized by sex, race/ethnicity, age at death, HIV transmission category, and lowest CD4 cell count of ASD decedents. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to estimate trends in proportionate mortality, as linear trends through all three HAART periods, mortality rates, and ART prevalence.RESULTS: Of 9225 deaths, 58.6% occurred during 1992-1995, 29.5% during 1996-1999, and 11.9% during 2000-2003. Linear trends in proportionate mortality for noninfectious diseases (e.g., liver disease, hypertension, and alcohol abuse) increased significantly; proportionate mortality for AIDS-defining infectious diseases (e.g., pneumocystosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, and cytomegalovirus disease) decreased significantly. Mortality rates decreased from 487.5/1000 person-years in 1995 to 100.6 in 2002. Of 36 256 patients from ASD, 75.7% (standardized average) were prescribed ART annually.CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected patients, the majority of whom were prescribed ART, the increasing trend in common noninfectious perimortal conditions support screening and treatment for these conditions in order to sustain the trend in declining mortality rates.","Epidemic Intelligence Service, Office of Workforce and Career Development, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA.",2007,NA

This study assesses the impact of a national quality improvement program on adherence to guidelines in these patients. Data from 92 hospitals from across the United States participating in the Get With The Guidelines program for at least 1 year for 11 acute and secondary prevention measures from a preintervention baseline period and the subsequent 4 quarters of a quality improvement intervention were analyzed. A patient group of 45,988 patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization, or peripheral vascular disease was included in this evaluation. Significant improvement from baseline was seen in 10 of 11 measures by the fourth quarter: use of early aspirin for acute myocardial infarction, 76.4% to 88.0% (P &lt; 0.0001); early beta-blocker for acute myocardial infarction, 64.4% to 79.5% (P &lt; 0.0001); beta-blocker at discharge, 75% to 82.1% (P &lt; 0.0001); smoking cessation counseling, 58.7% to 74.3% (P &lt; 0.0001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use for acute myocardial infarction, 64.5% to 69.9% (P &lt; 0.0001); lipid treatment, 58.5% to 63.4% (P &lt; 0.0001); lipid treatment for low-density lipoprotein &gt; or =100 mg/dL, 60.4% to 67.0% (P &lt; 0.0001); low-density-lipoprotein measurement, 48.8% to 53.2% (P &lt; 0.0001); discharge blood pressure &lt;140/90 mm Hg, 65.9% to 68.0% (P = 0.03); and referral to cardiac rehabilitation or exercise counseling, 65.0% to 88.3% (P &lt; 0.001).

Risk factors for bleeding events and supratherapeutic INR (at least 0.5 units above the target range) were evaluated longitudinally by using generalized estimating equation (GEE) modeling. Of the 171 patients completing a diary, 87 (51%) reported at least one bleeding event and 36 (21%) had a supratherapeutic INR. Seventy-three patients (43%) indicated they had used at least one CAM product previously reported to interact with warfarin. Warfarin use of less than 3 months' duration was the only statistically significant risk factor identified for supratherapeutic INR. The CAM therapies associated with an increased risk of self-reported bleeding included cayenne, ginger, willow bark, St. John's wort, and coenzyme Q(10). Use of more than one CAM while receiving warfarin was also a significant risk factor. Two CAMs were independently associated with an increased risk of self-reported bleeding: coenzyme Q(10) (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.88-7.24) and ginger (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.42-4.24). Other risk factors significantly associated with increased bleeding included high target INR (2.5-3.5), diarrhea, acetaminophen use, increased alcohol consumption, and increased age.CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM by patients receiving warfarin is common, and consumption of coenzyme Q(10) or ginger appears to increase the risk of bleeding in this population.","Pharmacy Department, Vancouver Coastal Health-Providence Health Care Pharmacy Services, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.",2007,NA
266,,17600651,Cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions for adolescents with a substance use disorder.,"Alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use among adolescents in the United States continues to be a serious public health challenge. A variety of outpatient treatments for adolescent substance use disorders have been developed and evaluated. Although no specific treatment modality is effective in all settings, a number of promising adolescent interventions have emerged. As policy makers try to prioritize which programs to fund with limited public resources, the need for systematic economic evaluations of these programs is critical. The present study attempted a cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions, including family-based, individual, and group cognitive behavioral approaches, for adolescents with a substance use disorder. The results indicated that treatment costs varied substantially across the four interventions. Moreover, family therapy showed significantly better substance use outcome compared to group treatment at the 4-month assessment, but group treatment was similar to the other interventions for substance use outcome at the 7-month assessment and for delinquency outcome at both the 4- and 7-month assessments. These findings over a relatively short follow-up period suggest that the least expensive intervention (group) was the most cost-effective. However, this study encountered numerous data and methodological challenges in trying to supplement a completed clinical trial with an economic evaluation. These challenges are explained and recommendations are proposed to guide future economic evaluations in this area.","Health Economics Research Group, Department of Sociology, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL 33124, USA. mfrench@miami.edu",2007,NA
267,,17589746,Prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated factors in a population-based study.,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence and identify associated factors among demographic, family, socioeconomic and mental health variables.METHODS: A household survey was carried out in the urban area of Campinas, southeastern Brazil, in 2003. A total of 515 subjects, aged 14 years or more were randomly selected using a stratified cluster sample. The Self-Report Questionnaire and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were used in the interview. Prevalences were calculated, and univariate and multivariate logistic analyses performed by estimating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence was 13.1% (95% CI: 8.4;19.9) in men and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.9;8.6) in women. In the final multiple logistic regression model, alcohol abuse/dependence was significantly associated with age, income, schooling, religion and illicit drug use. The adjusted odds ratios were significantly higher in following variables: income between 2,501 and 10,000 dollars (OR=10.29); income above 10,000 dollars (OR=10.20); less than 12 years of schooling (OR=13.42); no religion (OR=9.16) or religion other than Evangelical (OR=4.77); and illicit drug use during lifetime (OR=4.47). Alcohol abuse and dependence patterns were different according to age group.CONCLUSIONS: There is a significantly high prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence in this population. The knowledge of factors associated with alcohol abuse, and differences in consumption patterns should be taken into account in the development of harm reduction strategies.","Departamento de Medicina Preventiva e Social, Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Universidade Estadual de Campinas, Campinas, SP, Brasil.",2007,NA

A community-based case-control study.,"AIMS: This study aims at evaluating the association between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illicit substance use disorders (SUD) (marijuana, cocaine and inhalants), controlling for the association with conduct disorder (CD), in a community-based sample of adolescents.DESIGN: Case-control, community-based study.SETTING: A delimited geographical area in the South of Brazil, served by four public health clinics.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 968 male adolescents (15-20 years of age) were screened for SUD in their households. Of the subjects who were screened positive, we selected 61 cases with illicit SUD. For each case we selected, from the group which was screened negative, three controls without illicit or alcohol SUD, matched by age and proximity with the case's household.MEASUREMENTS: The screening instrument was the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Screening Test (ASSIST). SUD diagnoses were assessed by the drug section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI). Other psychiatric diagnoses were based on semistructured (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-epidemiological version; MINI) and clinical interviews.FINDINGS: Adolescents with ADHD presented a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) for illicit SUD than youths without ADHD, even after adjusting for potential confounders (CD, ethnicity, religion and estimated IQ) (OR = 9.12; 95% CI = 2.84-29.31, P &lt; 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an association between ADHD and illicit SUD in Brazilian adolescents that is not mediated by CD.

A retrospective case-control study nested in a cohort study was conducted using prospectively collected data from the Veterans Integrated Service Networks 16 VA database from 1998 to 2004. We analyzed data on 483,733 patients from eight states located in south central United States. The primary variables of interest were lung cancer and the use of statins prior to the diagnosis of lung cancer. Multiple logistic regression analysis was done to adjust for covariates including age, sex, body mass index, smoking, diabetes, and race. Statistical software was used for statistical computing.RESULTS: Of the 483,733 patients in the study, 163,662 patients (33.8%) were receiving statins and 7,280 patients (1.5%) had a primary diagnosis of lung cancer. Statin use &gt; 6 months was associated with a risk reduction of lung cancer of 55% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.48; p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, the protective effect of statin was seen across different age and racial groups and was irrespective of the presence of diabetes, smoking, or alcohol use.CONCLUSIONS: Statins appear to be protective against the development of lung cancer, and further studies need to be done to define the clinical utility of statins as chemo protective agents.","Department of Medicine, Overton Brooks VAMC, East Stoner Avenue 151 (Research), Shreveport, LA 71101, USA. khuranav@gmail.com",2007,NA

The aim of this study was to provide periodontal treatment for pregnant women and to evaluate if this treatment can interfere with pregnancy duration and weight of the newborn.METHODS: The sample consisted of 450 pregnant women who were under prenatal care at a polyclinic in Três Corações, Brazil. Women with risk factors, such as systemic alterations (ischemic cardiopathy, hypertension, tuberculosis, diabetes, cancer, anemia, seizure, psychopathology, urinary tract infection, sexually transmitted diseases, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus), and/or users of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs were excluded from the study. Data related to age, socioeconomic level, race, marital status, number of previous pregnancies, and previous preterm delivery also were evaluated. Initially, the sample was divided into two groups: 122 healthy patients (group 1) and 328 patients with periodontal disease (group 2). In group 2, 266 patients underwent treatment and 62 patients dropped out. After mothers gave birth, pregnancy duration and the weight of all infants were analyzed and recorded.RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between the healthy and treated groups. However, there was a difference in the non-treated group, with a 79% incidence of preterm low birth weight.

As part of a larger study on self-care for symptoms in HIV disease, this study analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of peripheral neuropathy in HIV disease, sociodemographic and disease-related correlates and self-care strategies. A convenience sample of 1,217 respondents was recruited from data collection sites in several US cities, Puerto Rico, Colombia and Taiwan. Results of the study indicated that respondents with peripheral neuropathy (n=450) identified 20 self-care behaviors including complementary therapies, use of medications, exercise and rest and/or elevation of extremities. Ratings of frequency and effectiveness were also included. An activities checklist summarized into five categories of self-care behaviors including activities/thoughts, exercise, medications, complementary therapies and substance was used to determine self-care behaviors. Taking a hot bath was the most frequent strategy used by those with peripheral neuropathy (n=292) and received the highest overall rating of effectiveness of any self-management strategies included in this study at 8.1 (scale 1-10). Other self-care strategies to manage this symptom included: staying off the feet (n=258), rubbing the feet with cream (n=177), elevating the feet (n=236), walking (n=262), prescribed anti-epileptic agent (n=80), prescribed analgesics (n=84), over-the-counter medications (n=123), vitamin B (n=122), calcium supplements (n=72), magnesium (n=48), massage (n=156), acupuncture (n=43), reflexology (n=23) and meditation (n=80).

272,,17257475,An evaluation of patient preference for an alternative insulin delivery system compared to standard vial and syringe.,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects over 18.2 million Americans and diabetes-related medical costs exceed 132 billion dollars per year, totaling more than 12% of the United States healthcare budget. The Diabetes Control and Complications Clinical Trial demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy and the control of plasma glucose can significantly reduce the incidence of late diabetic complications and delay the progression of existing conditions in type 1 diabetes. Optimal glycemic control often requires intensive insulin therapy to maintain a hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C) of less than 7% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association. It is estimated that more than half of the approximately 7 million Americans using insulin do so with suboptimal treatment and while administering one or two insulin injections per day. Non-adherence may be a contributing factor in suboptimal treatment. For a variety of reasons, many patients diagnosed with diabetes and treated with insulin are non-adherent.SCOPE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate preference for an insulin delivery system comparing a disposable doser (InnoLet) to the standard vial/syringe. In a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover study, 260 patients were enrolled (age &gt; or = 18 years, with type 1 or 2 diabetes, and receiving NPH or regular or 70/30 insulin for at least 6-months). A total of 162 patients completed both treatment arms. Excluded were those unable to read/write English or administer their own injections, pregnant/lactating women, those using antipsychotics, and those with a history of alcohol abuse or cognitive impairment. Patients completed the eight-item Diabetes Fear of Self-Injection Questionnaire at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Items were rated on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = almost never; 4 = almost always) with a maximum fear score of 32. At week 24, patients completed a preference survey.FINDINGS: Of the 162 patients completing both treatment arms, 89 (55.0%) were in the vial/syringe to disposable doser treatment arm, 50% were female and mean age was 60 +/- 11 years. Patients in both treatment arms displayed little significant differences in baseline characteristics. Patients reported significantly lower fear of self-injection after using the disposable doser compared to vial/syringe (mean +/- SEM: 9.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.4; p &lt; 0.0001). Most patients (71.5%) indicated a preference for the disposable doser compared to the vial/syringe method (p &lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSION: The majority of patients preferred the disposable doser, and reported significantly less fear of self-injection using this delivery system. There are some potential limitations to consider. A randomization bias may have been present, patients who enrolled in this study were those who were actively seeking medical treatment for diabetes, insulin pens and cartridges are not available for all types of insulin regimens, pre-filled pens and cartridges may not be altered and, in general, alternative insulin delivery systems tend to be more costly than insulin sold in traditional vials. However, insulin may have greater patient acceptance and less psychological distress when administered via an alternative delivery system.","Prescription Solutions, Irvine, CA 92614-6223, USA.",2007,NA

Combined settings had higher proportions of women at risk for AEP (12.5% overall) than in the general population (2%).INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive information plus a brief motivational intervention (n=416) or to receive information only (n=414). The brief motivational intervention consisted of four counseling sessions and one contraception consultation and services visit.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women consuming more than five drinks on any day or more than eight drinks per week on average, were considered risk drinkers; women who had intercourse without effective contraception were considered at risk of pregnancy. Reversing either or both risk conditions resulted in reduced risk of an AEP.RESULTS: Across the follow-up period, the odds ratios (ORs) of being at reduced risk for AEP were twofold greater in the intervention group: 3 months, 2.31 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.69-3.20); 6 months, 2.15 (CI=1.52-3.06); 9 months, 2.11 (CI=1.47-3.03).

274,,23074503,Multidetector computed tomography for coronary artery disease screening in asymptomatic populations: evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: This evidence-based health technology assessment systematically reviewed the published literature on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography (with contrast) as a diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease (CAD), and applied the results of the assessment to health care practices in Ontario.CLINICAL NEED: Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in the western world. Occlusion of coronary arteries reduces coronary blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardium (heart muscle). The rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque may result in myocardial infarction. If left untreated, CAD can result in heart failure and, subsequently, death. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, 54% of all cardiovascular deaths are due to CAD. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and genetics), underlying clinical conditions that predispose to cardiac conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and elevated cholesterol), lifestyle characteristics, (e.g., obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity), and, more recently, determinants of health (e.g., socioeconomic status) may predict the risk of getting CAD. In 2004/2005, The Ontario government funded approximately 15,400 percutaneous (through the skin) coronary interventions and 7,840 coronary bypass procedures for the treatment of CAD. These numbers are expected to reach 22,355 for percutaneous coronary interventions and 12,323 for coronary bypass procedures in 2006/2007. It was noted that more than one-half of all first coronary events occur in people without symptoms of CAD. In Ontario in 2000/2001, $457.9 million (Cdn) was spent on invasive ($237.4 million) and noninvasive ($220.5 million) cardiac services. The use of noninvasive cardiac tests, in particular, is rising rapidly.THE TECHNOLOGY: Computed tomography (CT) is a medical imaging method employing tomography where digital geometry processing is used to generate a 3-dimensional image of the internals of an object from a large series of 2-dimensional X-ray images taken around a single axis of rotation. Multidetector computed tomography is performed for noninvasive imaging of the coronary arteries. Computer software quantifies the amount of calcium within the coronary arteries and calculates a coronary artery calcium score. Compared with conventional CT scanning, MDCT can provide smaller pieces of information and cover a larger area faster. Advanced MDCT technology (that is, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-slice systems) can produce more images in less time. For general CT scanning, this faster capability can reduce the length of time people are required to be still during the procedure and thereby reduce potential movement artifact. However, the additional clinical utility of images obtained from faster scanners compared with the images obtained from conventional CT scanners for current CT indications (i.e., nonmoving body parts) is unknown.REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat completed a computer-aided search limited to English-language studies in humans from 1998 to 2007 in multiple medical literature databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and INAHTA/CRD. Case reports, letters, editorials, nonsystematic reviews, and comments were excluded. Additional studies that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were obtained from reference lists of included studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the results according to the criteria listed below. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the overall quality of the body of evidence (defined as 1 or more studies) supporting the research questions explored in this systematic review.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Screening the asymptomatic population for CAD using MDCT does not meet World Health Organization criteria for screening; hence, it is not justifiable. Coronary artery calcification measured by MDCT is a good predictor of future cardiovascular events. However, MDCT exhibits only moderately high sensitivity and specificity for detection of CAD in an asymptomatic population. If population-based screening were implemented, a high rate of false positives would result in increased downstream costs and interventions. Additionally, some cases of CAD would be missed, as they may not be developed, or not yet have progressed to detectable levels. There is no evidence for the impact of screening on patient management. Cardiovascular risk factors are positively associated with the presence of coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular events; however, risk factor stratification to identify high-risk asymptomatic individuals is unclear given the current evidence-base. Safety of MDCT screening is also an issue because of the introduction of increased radiation doses for the initial screening scan and possible follow-up interventions. No large randomized controlled trials of MDCT screening have been published, which indicates an important area of future research. Lastly, the policy implications for MDCT screening for CAD in the asymptomatic population are significant. There is no evidence on the long-term implications of screening, and the potential impact on the resources of the health care system is considerable.",NA,2007,NA

Participants Alcohol dependent individuals (n = 1335) entering out-patient treatment in the Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) study.MEASUREMENTS: The AUDIT was administered as part of an initial screening. Baseline measures used for concurrent validation included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) Disorders, the Alcohol Dependence Scale, the Drinker Inventory of Consequences, the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking Scale, the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment, the Thoughts about Abstinence Scale, the Form-90, %carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and gamma-glutamyl transferase. Findings Indicators of severity of dependence and alcohol-related problems increased linearly with total score and differed significantly across AUDIT zones. The highest zone, with scores of 20 and above, was markedly different with respect to severity from the other two zones and members of this group endorsed an abstinence goal more strongly.CONCLUSIONS: The AUDIT total score is a brief measure that appears to provide an index of severity of dependence in a sample of alcohol-dependent individuals seeking out-patient treatment, extending its potential utility beyond its more traditional role as a screening instrument in general populations.","Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98105-4631, USA. ddonovan@u.washington.edu",2006,NA
276,,17062546,Initial steps taken by nine primary care practices to implement alcohol screening guidelines with hypertensive patients: the AA-TRIP project.,"Many medical conditions are caused or exacerbated by heavy drinking, necessitating alcohol screening and discussion in primary care practices. This is particularly true of hypertension, the most common primary diagnosis in the United States, which has been linked to the regular consumption of 3 or more standard alcoholic beverages a day. The Accelerating Alcohol Screening-Translating Research into Practice (AA-TRIP) project was designed to improve detection and management of alcohol problems in primary care patients with hypertension. Medical providers are being trained using the Practice Partner Research Network's- Translating Research into Practice (PPRNet-TRIP) quality improvement model. This includes a multi-method intervention (electronic medical records, on-site academic detailing, practice feedback reports and annual network meetings) to help practices increase adherence to clinical guidelines. Qualitative analyses of initial steps taken by nine primary care practices toward the routine implementation of alcohol screening guidelines are presented. Organizational factors and provider and patient characteristics all influenced the method and consistency of alcohol screening and intervention. Perceived time constraints, patient sensitivity to questions about alcohol, and possible stigma associated with a diagnosis of alcoholism were also relevant barriers requiring problem solving.","Center for Drug and Alcohol Programs, Medical University of South Carolina, 67 President St, PO Box 250861, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. millerpm@musc.edu",2006,NA
277,,17040543,Evidence for smoking cessation: Implications for gender-specific strategies.,"BACKGROUND: Facilitating smoking cessation requires an evidence-based approach. The Lienhard School of Nursing Institute for Healthy Aging in the United States, whose focus is providing health information to aging baby boomers, developed an interest in studying strategies for smoking cessation in women.APPROACH: Studies were reviewed and critiqued related to the question: What is the relative efficacy of first-line smoking cessation interventions for women versus men in the 40- to 65-year-old age group? This article first discusses the procedure used to construct an integrative framework for finding the evidence on smoking cessation, including a literature search and refinement of the problem to be studied, and then a summary of the evidence gathered on the selected variable (gender) and interventions (counseling, pharmacotherapy, nicotine replacement therapy).FINDINGS: Evidence was found that supports the general efficacy of three first-line smoking cessation interventions: counseling, bupropion-sustained release (BSR), and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). What the evidence does not show, however, is which of these interventions may be more effective for women versus men in general or specifically in the 40- to 65-year-old age group.RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations include the development of a clinical trial and the inclusion from the outset of gender as a major variable in all future intervention studies.IMPLICATIONS: Practice implications include the fact that since effective treatments already exist for assisting clients to stop smoking, all health-care providers should offer an intervention that has been found effective to any client who expresses a desire to quit smoking. Further studies of efficacy are needed to develop more focused implications.","Institute for Healthy Aging, Pace University, New York, NY 10038, USA. jsingleton@pace.edu",2006,NA
278,,17038099,Brief interventions for high-risk drinkers.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to explore the literature on brief alcohol intervention and to review the literature that examines the status of the clinic nurse in the delivery of these interventions. The objective is to review critically the literature on brief intervention to create links for nurse developed and delivered brief intervention to high-risk drinkers.BACKGROUND: Population estimates suggest that more than one-third of North Americans drink excessively with even higher rates for individuals treated in primary care settings. Alcohol use has been identified as the third leading cause of mortality in the United States. This problem is not unique to the US and, worldwide, agencies and governmental offices and ministries have issued recommendations to screen patients for alcohol misuse and deliver brief interventions to individuals considered to be high-risk drinkers. Numerous randomized controlled trials and recent meta-analyses have supported the use of screening and brief intervention for reducing alcohol consumption in primary healthcare settings. The vast majority of studies reporting on brief interventions have focused on the role of the physician with minimal if any involvement of the clinic nurse. A scant number of studies have been conducted that define and assess the role or potential role of the clinic nurse in providing screening and brief intervention to high-risk drinkers in the primary care setting.METHODS: Systematic review.RESULTS: Six systematic reviews and meta-analyses from an international base of studies support the use of brief intervention in the primary care setting. Three randomized control trials have highlighted the role of the staff or clinic nurse but there are no meta-analyses addressing nurse-delivered brief interventions. Numerous studies have explored factors effecting the implementation of brief intervention into the primary care setting.CONCLUSION: Brief intervention is recognized as a legitimate nursing role but little has been done to develop and define the role of the nurse in delivering brief interventions to high-risk drinkers. This represents a major lacuna in both the nursing and alcoholism literature, where only a handful of studies have investigated nurse-delivered brief intervention.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As health screening and health promotion are hallmarks of nursing care, nurses need to explore the use of brief intervention in their daily practice.","Department of Nursing, Daemen College, Amherst, NY, USA. zhyman@daemen.edu",2006,NA

Among screen-positive patients, 42% (range, 5%-84%) had documented follow-up assessment, but absolute numbers of screen-positive patients evaluated were small (27-80 patients per network). Based on 235 481 patient surveys, the prevalence of alcohol misuse was 22% (range, 15%-27% across networks), and 28% (range, 20%- 36%) of screen-positive patients reported receiving alcohol-related advice. Alcohol-related advice increased as AUDIT-C scores increased.CONCLUSION: The VA successfully implemented evidence-based alcohol screening, but the rate of follow-up among screen-positive patients remained low.","Health Services Research and Development (152), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, 1100 Olive Way, Ste 1400, Seattle, WA 98101, USA. willi@u.washington.edu",2006,NA
280,,16966982,Effectiveness of brief interventions after alcohol-related vehicular injury: A randomized controlled trial.,"BACKGROUND: Because 40% of motor vehicle fatalities in the United States are alcohol-related, interventions delivered by trauma clinicians targeted to reduce drinking are of particular importance to public health. The objective of this study was to test the effectiveness of hospital-based brief intervention strategies to reduce alcohol consumption and other health-related outcomes in the year after an alcohol-related vehicular injury. Brief interventions are clinically based strategies including assessment and direct feedback about drinking alcohol, goal setting, behavioral modification techniques, and the use of a self-help manual.METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial of two types of brief intervention with a 12-month follow-up. Participants with alcohol-related vehicular injury who were admitted to Level I trauma centers were eligible for enrollment. Enrolled participants were randomized to a control, simple advice, or brief counseling condition. Primary outcome variables were alcohol consumption (standard drinks/month, binges/month), adverse driving events (driving citations, traffic crashes), and changes in health status (hospital and emergency department admissions).RESULTS: The study enrolled 187 participants at baseline and retained 100 across 12 months. Participants had a significant decrease in alcohol consumption and traffic citations at 12 months as compared with baseline. Mean standard drinks/month declined from 56.80 (SD 63.89) at baseline to 32.10 (SD 53.20) at 12 months. Mean binges/month declined from 5.79 (SD 6.98) at baseline to 3.21 (SD 6.17) at 12 months. There were no differences in alcohol consumption, adverse driving events, or health status by condition.CONCLUSIONS: Whether the reductions in alcohol consumption and traffic citations were a result of the crash, hospitalization for injury, screening for alcohol use, or combination of these factors is difficult to determine. Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved in reductions of health-related outcomes and the role of brief intervention in this population.","School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA. ssommer@nursing.upenn.edu",2006,NA
281,,16856093,Psychotherapeutic interventions for cannabis abuse and/or dependence in outpatient settings.,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder is the most common illicit substance use disorder in general population. Despite that, only a minority seek assistance from a health professional, but the demand for treatment is now increasing internationally. Trials of treatment have been published but to our knowledge, there is no published systematic review .OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for cannabis abuse or dependence.SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL) The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2004; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2004), PsycInfo (1985 to October 2004), CINAHL (1982 to October 2004), Toxibase (until September 2004) and reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field.SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled studies examining a psychotherapeutic intervention for cannabis dependence or abuse in comparison with a delayed-treatment control group or combinations of psychotherapeutic interventions.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted dataMAIN RESULTS: Six trials involving 1297 people were included. Five studies took place in the United States, one in Australia. Studies were not pooled in meta-analysis because of heterogeneity. The six included studies suggested that counseling approaches might have beneficial effects for the treatment of cannabis dependence. Group and individual sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had both efficacy for the treatment of cannabis dependence and associated problems, CBT produced better outcomes than a brief intervention when CBT was delivered in individual sessions. Two studies suggested that adding voucher-based incentives may enhance treatment when used in combination with other effective psychotherapeutic interventions. Abstinence rates were relatively small overall but favored the individual CBT 9-session (or more) condition. All included trials reported a statistically significant reductions in frequency of cannabis use and dependence symptoms. But other measures of problems related to cannabis use were not consistently different.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included studies were too heterogenous and could not allow to draw up a clear conclusion. The studies comparing different therapeutic modalities raise important questions about the duration, intensity and type of treatment. The generalizability of findings is also unknown because the studies have been conducted in a limited number of localities with fairly homogenous samples of treatment seekers. However, the low abstinence rate indicated that cannabis dependence is not easily treated by psychotherapies in outpatient settings.","Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux - Centre Carreire du CHCP, Laboratoire de Psychiatrie, 121 rue de la Bechade, Bordeaux Cedex, European Union 33076. cecile.denis@labopsy.u-bordeaux2.fr",2006,NA

Preventive Care Checklist Forms were created to be used by family physicians at adult health check-ups over a five-month period. The sex-specific forms incorporate evidence-based recommendations on preventive health services and documentation space for routine procedures such as physical examination. The forms were used in two intervention clinics and two control clinics. Rates and relative risks (RR) of the performance of 13 preventive health maneuvers at baseline and post-intervention and the percentage of up-to-date preventive health services delivered per patient were compared between the two groups.RESULTS: Randomly-selected charts were reviewed at baseline (n = 509) and post-intervention (n = 608). Baseline rates for provision of preventive health services ranged from 3% (fecal occult blood testing) to 93% (blood pressure measurement), similar to other settings. The percentage of up-to-date preventive health services delivered per patient at the end of the intervention was 48.9% in the control group and 71.7% in the intervention group. This is an overall 22.8% absolute increase (p = 0.0001), and 46.6% relative increase in the delivery of preventive health services per patient in the intervention group compared to controls. Eight of thirteen preventive health services showed a statistically significant change (p &lt; 0.05) in favor of the intervention (adjusted RR (95% C.I.)): counseling on brushing/flossing teeth (9.2 (4.3-19.6)), folic acid counseling (7.5 (2.7-20.8)), fecal occult blood testing (6.7 (1.9-24.1)), smoking cessation counseling (3.9 (2.2-7.2)), tetanus immunization (3.0 (1.7-5.2)), history of alcohol intake (1.33 (1.2-1.5)), history of smoking habits (1.28 (1.2-1.4)) and blood pressure measurement (1.05 (1.00-1.10)).CONCLUSION: This simple, low cost, clinically relevant intervention improves the delivery of preventive health services by prompting physicians of evidence-based recommendations in a checklist format that incorporates existing practice patterns. Periodic updates of the Preventive Care Checklist Forms will allow a feasible and easy-to-use tool for primary care physicians to provide evidence-based preventive health services to adults at routine health check-ups. The forms can also be incorporated into an electronic health record.

The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35% female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health, fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications. Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p &lt; .0001).","Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Emory University, USA.",2006,NA

Data were collected via telephone interviews.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Nicotine dependence, intention to quit, and self-efficacy to quit smoking were the main outcome measures used in this study.RESULTS: Lower levels of education were associated with higher nicotine dependence. The effect of lower income on higher heaviness of smoking index (HIS) scores was significant in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Respondents with low education had 35% larger odds of low self-efficacy than those with high education. Respondents with low education had 40% larger odds of having no intention to quit than those with high education. Respondents with low income had 23% larger odds of having no intention to quit than those with high income. Country was not a moderator of the association of SES with self-efficacy and intention to quit.CONCLUSION: To the extent that lower SES smokers are more addicted, they are likely to need more intensive support if they are to be successful in their attempts to quit. Given their lower incomes, this places a special responsibility on government to provide or subsidise such services. This should include access to the widest possible range of effective pharmacotherapies complemented with evidence based counselling and support.","Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Control Research Institute, The Cancer Council Victoria, 100 Drummond Street, Carlton 3053, Australia. mohammad.siahpush@cancervic.org.au",2006,NA

Effectiveness expressed as odds ratios for quitting associated with pharmacotherapies. Costs based on the additional physician time required and retail prices of the medications.INTERVENTIONS: Addition of each first-line pharmacotherapy to GP cessation counselling.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per life-year saved associated with pharmacotherapies.RESULTS: The cost per life-year saved for counselling only ranged from US190 dollars in Spain to 773 dollars in the UK for men, and from 288 dollars in Spain to 1168 dollars in the UK for women. The incremental cost per life-year saved for gum ranged from 2230 dollars for men in Spain to 7643 dollars for women in the US; for patch from 1758 dollars for men in Spain to 5131 dollars for women in the UK; for spray from 1935 dollars for men in Spain to 7969 dollars for women in the US; for inhaler from 3480 dollars for men in Switzerland to 8700 dollars for women in France; and for bupropion from 792 dollars for men in Canada to 2922 dollars for women in the US. In sensitivity analysis, changes in discount rate, treatment effectiveness, and natural quit rate had the strongest influences on cost-effectiveness.CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of the pharmacotherapies varied significantly across the six study countries, however, in each case, the results would be considered favourable as compared to other common preventive pharmacotherapies.","Department of Ambulatory and Community Medicine, University Hospital, CH-1011 Lausanne, Switzerland. jacques.cornuz@chuv.hospvd.ch",2006,NA

In the United States, major gains have been made to reduce smoking among adults. Similar gains, however, have not been realized with adolescents. In recent years, substantial interest has been directed to tobacco cessation studies with adolescents. The previously limited interest in adolescent cessation programs was attributable in large part to the mistaken assumptions that: (1) adolescent tobacco users were not dependent on nicotine and could stop at any time; (2) adolescents did not want to quit; and (3) adult tobacco cessation programs would be effective with adolescents. The need for programs to increase adolescent cessation attempts is underscored by the Healthy People 2010 goal that calls for an increase in tobacco use cessation attempts by adolescent smokers to 84%. Dental providers need to take steps to prevent tobacco use by adolescent patients. For those who are already addicted, they need to provide cessation counseling services or referral for appropriate treatment. The purpose of this paper was to provide dental clinicians with information on: (1) tobacco and health; (2) the epidemiology of adolescent tobacco use; and (3) tobacco cessation programs for parents and adolescents that can be implemented in the dental office setting.","Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, New York, NY, USA. daa1@columbia.edu",2006,NA

Adherence monitoring with screening tests, and urine drug testing, periodic monitoring with prescription monitoring programs, has become a common practice in recent years. Random drug testing for appropriate use of opioids and use of illicit drugs is often used in pain management practices. Thus, it is expected that random urine drug testing will deter use of illicit drugs, and also improve compliance.OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of illicit drug use in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain management and to compare the results of illicit drug use with the results from a previous study.DESIGN: A prospective, consecutive study.SETTING: Interventional pain management practice setting in the United States.METHODS: A total of 500 consecutive patients on opioids, considered to be receiving stable doses of opioids supplemental to their interventional techniques, were studied by random drug testing. Testing was performed by rapid drug screen. Results were considered positive if one or more of the monitored illicit drugs including cocaine, marijuana (THC), methamphetamine or amphetamines were present.RESULTS: Illicit drug use was evident in 80 patients, or 16%, with marijuana in 11%, cocaine in 5%, and methamphetamine and/or amphetamines in 2%. When compared with previous data, the overall illicit drug use was significantly less. Illicit drug use in elderly patients was absent.CONCLUSION: The prevalence of illicit drug abuse in patients with chronic pain receiving opioids continues to be a common occurence.

The prevalence of light smoking in the United States is increasing, yet there has not been a single smoking cessation clinical trial targeting light smokers. The purpose of this 2 x 2 factorial, randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine gum (2 mg versus placebo) and counseling (motivational interviewing versus health education) for African American light smokers.DESIGN: Participants were assigned randomly to one of four study arms: 2 mg nicotine gum plus health education (HE); 2 mg nicotine gum plus motivational interviewing (MI); placebo gum plus HE; and placebo gum plus MI.PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 755 African American light smokers (66% female, mean age = 45) were enrolled at a community health center over a 16-month period.INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants received an 8-week supply of nicotine gum and six counseling sessions during the course of the 26-week study. Biochemical measures included expired carbon monoxide (CO) and serum and salivary cotinine.FINDINGS: Seven-day quit rates for nicotine gum were no better than for the placebo group (14.2% versus 11.1%, P = 0.232) at 6 months. However, a counseling effect emerged, with HE performing significantly better than MI (16.7% versus 8.5%, P &lt; 0.001). These results were consistent across outcome time-points (weeks 1, 8, and 26).CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the potential positive impact of directive information and advice-oriented counseling on smoking cessation. Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to quit.","Department of Internal Medicine, University of Minnesota Academic Health Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. jahluwal@umn.edu",2006,NA

Limited information exists regarding early markers for the development of ESRD. This study aimed to determine over 25 yr the risk for ESRD associated with proteinuria, estimated GFR (eGFR), and hematocrit in men who did not have identified kidney disease and were randomly assigned into the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Study (MRFIT). A total of 12,866 men who were at high risk for heart disease were enrolled (1973 to 1975) and followed through 1999. Renal replacement therapy was ascertained by matching identifiers with the United States Renal Data System's data; vital status was from the National Death Index. Men who initiated renal replacement therapy or died as a result of kidney disease were deemed to have developed ESRD. Dipstick urine for proteinuria, eGFR, and hematocrit were related to development of ESRD. During 25 yr, 213 (1.7%) men developed ESRD. Predictors of ESRD were dipstick proteinuria of 1+ or &gt; or =2+ (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 5.4] and 15.7 [95% CI 10.3 to 23.9] respectively) and an eGFR of &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.8). Correlation between eGFR and serum creatinine was 0.9; the risk for ESRD with a 1-SD difference of each was identical (HR 1.21). Bivariate analysis demonstrated a 41-fold increase in ESRD risk in those with an eGFR &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and &gt; or =2+ proteinuria (95% CI 15.2 to 71.1). There was no association between hematocrit and ESRD. Other baseline measures that independently predicted ESRD included age, cigarette smoking, BP, low HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Among middle-aged men who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease but had no clinical evidence of cardiovascular disease or significant kidney disease, dipstick proteinuria and an eGFR value &lt;60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were strong predictors of long-term development of ESRD. It remains unknown whether intervention for proteinuria or early identification of those with chronic kidney disease reduces the risk for ESRD.","Division of Nephrology (111J), Department of Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, One Veterans Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55417, USA. areef.ishani@med.va.gov",2006,NA
291,,16562408,The efficacy of experimental interventions designed to reduce drinking among designated drivers.,"OBJECTIVE: Designated drivers are a popular strategy for avoiding drunk driving. However, studies have demonstrated that the strategy is often implemented poorly, resulting in diminished risk-reduction effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of six interventions designed to reduce alcohol consumption among designated drivers.METHOD: A total of 376 groups consisting of 1,412 pedestrians (57.8% men) were recruited as they crossed into Tijuana, Mexico, from San Diego, CA. Before crossing into Mexico, each group was assigned at random to one of six experimental conditions or to one control condition. The six interventions were designed to (1) cue the use of designated drivers, (2) change attitudes about designated drivers, (3) provide monetary rewards for driver sobriety, and (4) increase group supportive norms for proper designated driver use. Participant breath alcohol concentrations (BrACs) were collected before entering Mexico and on return to the United States.RESULTS: Using group members to deliver pro-designated driver messages significantly decreased driver and passenger BrACs relative to controls. Male drivers were more likely to return from Mexico with BrACs of zero if they were rewarded. Among female drivers, wearing a bracelet with the printed words &quot;designated driver&quot; in addition to cuing resulted in 9 of 10 drivers returning with BrACs equal to zero.CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that designated driver sobriety can be enhanced through brief interventions, and proper use of the designated driver concept did not increase the risk of excessive alcohol consumption for passengers.","AOD Initiatives Research, San Diego State University, 6386 Alvarado Court, Suite 224, San Diego, California 92120, USA. jlange@mail.sdsu.edu",2006,NA
292,,16528943,Costs of a smoking cessation counseling intervention for pregnant women: comparison of three settings.,"OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of smoking among women giving birth in the United States has declined steadily from 19.5% in 1989 to 11.4% in 2002, it still far exceeds the Healthy People 2010 goal of 1%. The objective of this study was to estimate the costs of a recommended five-step smoking cessation counseling intervention for pregnant women.METHODS: Costs were compared across three settings: a clinical trial, a quit line, and a rural managed care organization. Cost data were collected from August 2002 to September 2003. Intervention costs were compared with potential neonatal cost savings from averted adverse outcomes using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Maternal and Child Health Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economics Costs software.RESULTS: The costs of implementing the intervention ranged from dollar 24 to dollar 34 per pregnant smoker counseled across the three settings. Potential neonatal cost savings that could be accrued from women who quit smoking during pregnancy were estimated at dollar 881 per maternal smoker. Assuming a 30% to 70% increase over baseline quit rates, interventions could net savings up to dollar 8 million within the range of costs per pregnant smoker.CONCLUSIONS: Costs may vary depending on the intensity and nature of the intervention; however, this analysis found a surprisingly narrow range across three disparate settings. Cost estimates presented here are shown to be low compared with potential cost savings that could be accrued across the quit rates that could be achieved through use of the 5A's smoking cessation counseling intervention.","School of Business, University of Houston Clear Lake, 2700 Bay Area Blvd. MC 73, Houston TX, 77058, USA.

Participated 1,199 adults, volunteers, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, randomly assigned to 10 different groups: intensive brief counseling group (GB), with 1 or 2 sessions (G1-G2), and with 3 or 4 sessions (G3-G4), with/without nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Abstinence proportions were estimated during 12 months. These proportions among participants not assigned to NRT were 20% (GB), 17% (G1-G2), and 23% (G3-G4); and among assigned NRT groups were 30% (GBA), 34% (G1A-G2A), and 33% (G3A-G4A). After multiple adjustments, the abstinence proportions ratios seemed to follow a &quot;dose-response&quot; pattern: compared to GB, the ratios were 0.85 (G1-G2), 1.13 (G3-G4), 1.51 (GBA), 1.66 (G1A-G2A), and 1.75 (G3A-G4A). The results suggest that use of NRT increases the abstinence proportion for cessation. The &quot;dose-response&quot; pattern suggests that cognitive-behavioral could be the reasonable option in the smoking cessation therapy.","Coordenação de Prevenção e Vigilância, Instituto Nacional de Câncer, Rua dos Inválidos 212, 2o andar, Rio de Janeiro, RJ 20231-020, Brazil. uotero@inca.gov.br",2006,NA
294,,16461864,Effects of lower-cost incentives on stimulant abstinence in methadone maintenance treatment: a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network study.,"BACKGROUND: Contingency management interventions that provide tangible incentives based on objective indicators of drug abstinence have improved treatment outcomes of substance abusers, but have not been widely implemented in community drug abuse treatment settings.OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes achieved when a lower-cost prize-based contingency management treatment is added to usual care in community methadone hydrochloride maintenance treatment settings.DESIGN: Random assignment to usual care with (n = 198) or without (n = 190) abstinence incentives during a 12-week trial.SETTING: Six community-based methadone maintenance drug abuse treatment clinics in locations across the United States.PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eighty-eight stimulant-abusing patients enrolled in methadone maintenance programs for at least 1 month and no more than 3 years.INTERVENTION: Participants submitting stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples earned draws for a chance to win prizes; the number of draws earned increased with continuous abstinence time.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples provided, percentage of stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples provided, longest duration of abstinence, retention, and counseling attendance.RESULTS: Submission of stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples was twice as likely for incentive as for usual care group participants (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-2.77). Achieving 4 or more, 8 or more, and 12 weeks of continuous abstinence was approximately 3, 9, and 11 times more likely, respectively, for incentive vs usual care participants. Groups did not differ on study retention or counseling attendance. The average cost of prizes was 120 dollars per participant.CONCLUSION: An abstinence incentive approach that paid 120 dollars in prizes per participant effectively increased stimulant abstinence in community-based methadone maintenance treatment clinics.","Mid Atlantic Node, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. jmpeirce@jhmi.edu",2006,NA

Conventional therapies have not always been effective. Literature regarding the use of auricular acupressure in substance abuse treatment is limited.OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of auricular acupressure in addition to usual care in substance abuse treatment, which has been limited.DESIGN AND SETTING: This placebo-controlled pilot study was carried out in a community mental health center in a US-Mexico border city (Las Cruces) in southwestern New Mexico.PARTICIPANTS: A majority were Hispanic males with an average age of 32.8 years. Participants reported an average lifetime use of drug of choice of 14 years.INTERVENTION: In addition to usual care, participants received specific acupressure treatment and placebo acupressure treatment. The acupressure treatment was offered once a week for 6 consecutive weeks.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) Depression Scale was administered before and after 6 weeks of treatment to assess changes in emotional distress. Brief Substance Craving Scale was used at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks to assess changes in craving.RESULTS: Both specific and placebo acupressure groups showed a significant reduction in craving at the end of treatment, with the specific acupressure group having a greater and more steady reduction in craving. Both specific acupressure and usual-care-only groups demonstrated a significant reduction in emotional stress.CONCLUSION: Overall, there was a positive response to the specific auricular acupressure treatment on psychological distress, craving, and drug/alcohol use measures. These encouraging preliminary results need to be duplicated in studies with larger sample sizes and longer treatment phases.","Department of Health Science at New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA.",2006,NA
296,,23074491,Utilization of DXA Bone Mineral Densitometry in Ontario: An Evidence-Based Analysis.,"ISSUE: Systematic reviews and analyses of administrative data were performed to determine the appropriate use of bone mineral density (BMD) assessments using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the associated trends in wrist and hip fractures in Ontario.BACKGROUND: DUAL ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY BONE MINERAL DENSITY ASSESSMENT: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry bone densitometers measure bone density based on differential absorption of 2 x-ray beams by bone and soft tissues. It is the gold standard for detecting and diagnosing osteoporosis, a systemic disease characterized by low bone density and altered bone structure, resulting in low bone strength and increased risk of fractures. The test is fast (approximately 10 minutes) and accurate (exceeds 90% at the hip), with low radiation (1/3 to 1/5 of that from a chest x-ray). DXA densitometers are licensed as Class 3 medical devices in Canada. The World Health Organization has established criteria for osteoporosis and osteopenia based on DXA BMD measurements: osteoporosis is defined as a BMD that is &gt;2.5 standard deviations below the mean BMD for normal young adults (i.e. T-score &lt;-2.5), while osteopenia is defined as BMD that is more than 1 standard deviation but less than 2.5 standard deviation below the mean for normal young adults (i.e. T-score&lt; -1 &amp; ≥-2.5). DXA densitometry is presently an insured health service in Ontario.CLINICAL NEED:   BURDEN OF DISEASE: The Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) found that 16% of Canadian women and 6.6% of Canadian men have osteoporosis based on the WHO criteria, with prevalence increasing with age. Osteopenia was found in 49.6% of Canadian women and 39% of Canadian men. In Ontario, it is estimated that nearly 530,000 Ontarians have some degrees of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis-related fragility fractures occur most often in the wrist, femur and pelvis. These fractures, particularly those in the hip, are associated with increased mortality, and decreased functional capacity and quality of life. A Canadian study showed that at 1 year after a hip fracture, the mortality rate was 20%. Another 20% required institutional care, 40% were unable to walk independently, and there was lower health-related quality of life due to attributes such as pain, decreased mobility and decreased ability to self-care. The cost of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures in Canada was estimated to be $1.3 billion in 1993.GUIDELINES FOR BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING: With 2 exceptions, almost all guidelines address only women. None of the guidelines recommend blanket population-based BMD testing. Instead, all guidelines recommend BMD testing in people at risk of osteoporosis, predominantly women aged 65 years or older. For women under 65 years of age, BMD testing is recommended only if one major or two minor risk factors for osteoporosis exist. Osteoporosis Canada did not restrict its recommendations to women, and thus their guidelines apply to both sexes. Major risk factors are age greater than or equal to 65 years, a history of previous fractures, family history (especially parental history) of fracture, and medication or disease conditions that affect bone metabolism (such as long-term glucocorticoid therapy). Minor risk factors include low body mass index, low calcium intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking.CURRENT FUNDING FOR BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING: The Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) Schedule presently reimburses DXA BMD at the hip and spine. Measurements at both sites are required if feasible. Patients at low risk of accelerated bone loss are limited to one BMD test within any 24-month period, but there are no restrictions on people at high risk. The total fee including the professional and technical components for a test involving 2 or more sites is $106.00 (Cdn).METHOD OF REVIEW: This review consisted of 2 parts. The first part was an analysis of Ontario administrative data relating to DXA BMD, wrist and hip fractures, and use of antiresorptive drugs in people aged 65 years and older. The Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences extracted data from the OHIP claims database, the Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital discharge abstract database, the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, and the Ontario Drug Benefit database using OHIP and ICD-10 codes. The data was analyzed to examine the trends in DXA BMD use from 1992 to 2005, and to identify areas requiring improvement. The second part included systematic reviews and analyses of evidence relating to issues identified in the analyses of utilization data. Altogether, 8 reviews and qualitative syntheses were performed, consisting of 28 published systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses, 34 randomized controlled trials, and 63 observational studies.FINDINGS OF UTILIZATION ANALYSIS: Analysis of administrative data showed a 10-fold increase in the number of BMD tests in Ontario between 1993 and 2005.OHIP claims for BMD tests are presently increasing at a rate of 6 to 7% per year. Approximately 500,000 tests were performed in 2005/06 with an age-adjusted rate of 8,600 tests per 100,000 population.Women accounted for 90 % of all BMD tests performed in the province.In 2005/06, there was a 2-fold variation in the rate of DXA BMD tests across local integrated health networks, but a 10-fold variation between the county with the highest rate (Toronto) and that with the lowest rate (Kenora). The analysis also showed that:With the increased use of BMD, there was a concomitant increase in the use of antiresorptive drugs (as shown in people 65 years and older) and a decrease in the rate of hip fractures in people age 50 years and older.Repeat BMD made up approximately 41% of all tests. Most of the people (&gt;90%) who had annual BMD tests in a 2-year or 3-year period were coded as being at high risk for osteoporosis.18% (20,865) of the people who had a repeat BMD within a 24-month period and 34% (98,058) of the people who had one BMD test in a 3-year period were under 65 years, had no fracture in the year, and coded as low-risk.Only 19% of people age greater than 65 years underwent BMD testing and 41% received osteoporosis treatment during the year following a fracture.Men accounted for 24% of all hip fractures and 21 % of all wrist fractures, but only 10% of BMD tests. The rates of BMD tests and treatment in men after a fracture were only half of those in women.In both men and women, the rate of hip and wrist fractures mainly increased after age 65 with the sharpest increase occurring after age 80 years.FINDINGS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND ANALYSIS: SERIAL BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING FOR PEOPLE NOT RECEIVING OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT: A systematic review showed that the mean rate of bone loss in people not receiving osteoporosis treatment (including postmenopausal women) is generally less than 1% per year. Higher rates of bone loss were reported for people with disease conditions or on medications that affect bone metabolism. In order to be considered a genuine biological change, the change in BMD between serial measurements must exceed the least significant change (variability) of the testing, ranging from 2.77% to 8% for precisions ranging from 1% to 3% respectively. Progression in BMD was analyzed, using different rates of baseline BMD values, rates of bone loss, precision, and BMD value for initiating treatment. The analyses showed that serial BMD measurements every 24 months (as per OHIP policy for low-risk individuals) is not necessary for people with no major risk factors for osteoporosis, provided that the baseline BMD is normal (T-score ≥ -1), and the rate of bone loss is less than or equal to 1% per year. The analyses showed that for someone with a normal baseline BMD and a rate of bone loss of less than 1% per year, the change in BMD is not likely to exceed least significant change (even for a 1% precision) in less than 3 years after the baseline test, and is not likely to drop to a BMD level that requires initiation of treatment in less than 16 years after the baseline test.SERIAL BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING IN PEOPLE RECEIVING OSTEOPOROSIS THERAPY: Seven published meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 2 recent RCTs on BMD monitoring during osteoporosis therapy showed that although higher increases in BMD were generally associated with reduced risk of fracture, the change in BMD only explained a small percentage of the fracture risk reduction.Studies showed that some people with small or no increase in BMD during treatment experienced significant fracture risk reduction, indicating that other factors such as improved bone microarchitecture might have contributed to fracture risk reduction.There is conflicting evidence relating to the role of BMD testing in improving patient compliance with osteoporosis therapy.Even though BMD may not be a perfect surrogate for reduction in fracture risk when monitoring responses to osteoporosis therapy, experts advised that it is still the only reliable test available for this purpose.A systematic review conducted by the Medical Advisory Secretariat showed that the magnitude of increases in BMD during osteoporosis drug therapy varied among medications. Although most of the studies yielded mean percentage increases in BMD from baseline that did not exceed the least significant change for a 2% precision after 1 year of treatment, there were some exceptions.BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING AND TREATMENT AFTER A FRAGILITY FRACTURE: A review of 3 published pooled analyses of observational studies and 12 prospective population-based observational studies showed that the presence of any prevalent fracture increases the relative risk for future fractures by approximately 2-fold or more.

297,,16282228,The importance of providing smoking relapse counseling during the postpartum hospitalization.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine during the postpartum period (a) the most feasible time for addressing smoking relapse, (b) the reasons women relapse, (c) differences in relapse rates in women who receive a counseling intervention in the immediate postpartum period compared to those who do not, and (d) differences in self-reporting of tobacco use compared to cotinine analysis.DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial.SETTING: Medical center in the Northeast United States and two prenatal care sites.PARTICIPANTS: A nonprobability convenience sample of 62 pregnant women.INTERVENTION: A brief counseling session using empowerment techniques, motivational interviewing, identification of stressors and individual coping strategies, and educational materials.MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Relapse to smoking measured by cotinine analysis and descriptive data collected during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods.RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of women relapsed to smoking by the 2nd week postdelivery, identifying rest and relaxation and depression as main factors for relapsing. Chi-square analysis showed no significant difference between the two groups regarding the intervention provided. There was a 39% discrepancy rate between self-reporting of tobacco use and cotinine analysis during pregnancy and a 27% discrepancy rate after delivery.CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high occurrence of relapse in the first 2 weeks after delivery, it is imperative that nurses provide interventions to women before their postpartum hospital discharge to prevent smoking relapse. Nurses should also address smoking behaviors each trimester because women stopped smoking at different time intervals and self-reported data were unreliable.","Drexel University, 245 N. 15th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19102, USA. tds@drexel.edu",2005,NA

Baseline assessment occurred at the moment of the first prescription and follow-up visits at the first, fourth and seventh month, from May 2001 to May 2003.METHODS: Non-adherence was self-reported and defined as the intake of less than 95% of the prescribed doses for 3 days before the follow-up interviews. Cumulative and person-time incidence were estimated and Cox's proportional model was used to assess the relative hazard (RH) of non-adherence with 95% confidence interval for both univariate and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Among 306 patients, the cumulative incidence of non-adherence was 36.9% (incidence rate 0.21/100 person-days). Multivariate analysis (P &lt; 0.05) showed that unemployment (RH = 2.17), alcohol use (RH = 2.27), self-report of three or more adverse reactions (RH = 1.64), number of pills per day (RH = 2.04), switch in antiretroviral regimen (RH = 2.72), and a longer time between the HIV test result and the first antiretroviral prescription (RH = 2.27) were associated with an increased risk of non-adherence, whereas the use of more than one health service indicated a negative association (RH = 0.54).CONCLUSION: The current analysis has pointed out the importance of clinical and health service characteristics as potential indicators of non-adherence after initiating therapy. Early assessment and intervention strategies should be priorities in these AIDS public referral centres. Feasible and reliable indicators for the routine monitoring of adherence should be incorporated in clinical practice.","Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, Institute of Exact Sciences, Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil.",2005,NA

We evaluated the consistency of PCP's attitudes toward smoking cessation counseling and corresponding smoking-cessation behaviors.DESIGN: This was a postintervention analysis of a population-based sample from a group randomized controlled trial to improve adherence to smoking cessation guidelines.SETTING: A total of 18 VA sites in Southwestern and Western United States participated.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 PCPs completed a survey at 12 months after the implementation of a smoking-cessation quality improvement (QI) program. Their patients also completed 12- (n = 1080) and 18-month (n = 924) follow-up surveys.INTERVENTION: The quality improvement intervention included local priority setting, quality improvement plan development, implementation, and monitoring.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCPs at intervention sites were more likely to report counseling patients about smoking cessation (P = 0.04) but not referral. PCP attitude toward smoking-cessation counseling was strongly associated with reported counseling (P &lt; 0.001) and with referral (P = 0.01). Other associations with counseling were the perceived barrier &quot;patients are not interested in quitting&quot; (P = 0.01) and fewer years in practice (P = 0.03); other associations with referral were specialty consultation (P &lt; 0.0001) and the perceived barrier &quot;referral not convenient&quot; (P = 0.001) (negative association). PCP attitudes were associated with higher rates of counseling, referral, and program attendance.CONCLUSIONS: PCPs, regardless of intervention participation, had attitudes consistent with their reported smoking-cessation behaviors and more favorable attitudes were associated with higher rates of patient-reported smoking cessation behavior. Findings suggest that PCPs who endorse smoking-cessation counseling and referral may provide more treatment recommendations and have higher patient quit rates.","RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California 90407-2138, USA. lisa_meredith@rand.org",2005,NA
301,,16009861,Adherence to heart failure quality-of-care indicators in US hospitals: analysis of the ADHERE Registry.,"BACKGROUND: Quality-of-care indicators have been developed for patients hospitalized with heart failure. However, little is known about current rates of conformity with these indicators or their variability across hospitals.METHODS: Data from 81 142 admissions occurring between July 1, 2002, and December 31, 2003, at 223 academic and non-academic hospitals in the United States participating in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) were analyzed. Rates of conformity with the 4 Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations core performance measures--discharge instructions (HF-1), assessment of left ventricular function (HF-2), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (HF-3), and smoking cessation counseling (HF-4)--as well as length of stay and in-hospital mortality rates were computed.RESULTS: Across all hospitals, the median rates of conformity with HF-1, HF-2, HF-3, and HF-4 were 24.0%, 86.2%, 72.0%, and 43.2%, respectively. Rates of conformity at individual hospitals varied from 0% to 100%, with statistically significant differences between academic and non-academic hospitals. Statistically significant positive independent predictors of overall conformity included the prevalence of comorbidities and the use of more intense pharmacologic management. Median hospital length of stay varied from 2.3 to 9.5 days, and in-hospital mortality varied from 0% to 11.1%.CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals providing care for patients with heart failure, there is significant individual variability in conformity to quality-of-care indicators and clinical outcomes and a substantial gap in overall performance. Establishing educational initiatives and quality improvement systems to reduce this variability and eliminate this gap would be expected to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Division of Cardiology, Ahmanson-UCLA Cardiomyopathy Center, The David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles 90095, USA. gfonarow@mednet.ucla.edu",2005,NA

303,,15913081,Crack use as a public health problem in Canada: call for an evaluation of 'safer crack use kits'.,"Oral crack use (smoking) is a relatively neglected public health problem in Canada, in comparison to injection drug use (IDU). There are indications that crack use in Canada may be increasing. Crack smoking involves particular risks and harms, including possible infectious disease transmission, which underline the need for targeted interventions. One pragmatic grassroots intervention that has only recently begun or been discussed in several Canadian cities is the distribution of 'safer crack use kits', which provide hardware for crack smoking devices along with harm reduction information. In addition to the direct benefits of using them, the kits may also bring previously 'hidden' marginalized crack smokers in contact with health and social services. There has been considerable controversy with regards to the distribution of the crack kits, within criminal justice, public health, and the general public; this resistance appears quite similar to that experienced when needle exchange programs (NEPs) were first being established. Systematic evaluation of the crack kits is urgently needed in order to produce definitive evidence of their health and other benefits, and to allow for evidence-based program and policy decisions in the interest of public health.","University of Toronto, Toronto, ON.",2005,NA
304,,15890989,Acute stroke care in the US: results from 4 pilot prototypes of the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry is being developed to improve the quality of acute stroke care. This article describes key features of acute stroke care from 4 prototype registries in Georgia (Ga), Massachusetts (Mass), Michigan (Mich), and Ohio.METHODS: Each prototype developed its own sampling scheme to obtain a representative sample of hospitals. Acute stroke admissions were identified using prospective (Mass, Mich) or retrospective (Ga, Ohio) methods. All prototypes used a common set of case definitions and data elements. Weighted site-specific frequencies were generated for each outcome.RESULTS: A total of 6867 admissions from 98 hospitals were included; the majority were ischemic strokes (range, 52% to 70%) with transient ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage comprising the bulk of the remainder. Between 19% and 26% of admissions were younger than age 60 years, and between 52% and 58% were female. Black subjects varied from 7.1% (Mich) to 30.6% (Ga). Between 20% and 25% of admissions arrived at the emergency department within 3 hours of onset. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) was administered to between 3.0% (Ga) and 8.5% (Mass) of ischemic stroke admissions.

Compliance with secondary prevention practices was poorest for smoking cessation counseling and best for antithrombotics.CONCLUSIONS: A minority of acute stroke patients are treated according to established guidelines. Quality improvement interventions, targeted primarily at the health care systems level, are needed to improve acute stroke care in the United States.","Michigan State University, East Lansing, USA. reevesm@msu.edu",2005,NA
305,,15768339,Factors associated with interest in initiating treatment for hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection among young HCV-infected injection drug users.,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify factors associated with interest in receiving therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among HCV-infected injection drug users (IDUs) in 3 United States cities.METHODS: IDUs aged 18-35 years who were HCV-infected and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus underwent surveys on behaviors, experience, and interest in treatment for HCV infection and readiness to quit drug use.RESULTS: Among treatment-naive IDUs (n=216), 81.5% were interested in treatment for HCV infection, but only 27.3% had seen a health-care provider since receiving a diagnosis of HCV infection. Interest in treatment for HCV infection was greater among IDUs with a high perceived threat of progressive liver disease, those with a usual source of care, those without evidence of alcohol dependence, and those with higher readiness scores for quitting drug use. Interest in treatment for HCV infection was 7-fold higher among IDUs who were told by their health-care provider that they were at risk for cirrhosis or liver cancer.CONCLUSIONS: Improving provider-patient communication and integrating treatments for substance abuse and HCV may increase the proportion of IDUs who initiate treatment for HCV infection.","Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, Division of International Health and Cross-Cultural Medicine, University of California, San Diego, California 92093, USA. sstrathdee@ucsd.edu",2005,NA
306,,15738468,Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis.,"The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is complex and guidelines are warranted. A subcommittee of the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Advisory Committee on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder reviewed, analysed and integrated current approaches to diagnosis to reach agreement on a standard in Canada. The purpose of this paper is to review and clarify the use of current diagnostic systems and make recommendations on their application for diagnosis of FASD-related disabilities in people of all ages. The guidelines are based on widespread consultation of expert practitioners and partners in the field. The guidelines have been organized into 7 categories: screening and referral; the physical examination and differential diagnosis; the neurobehavioural assessment; and treatment and follow-up; maternal alcohol history in pregnancy; diagnostic criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS and alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder; and harmonization of Institute of Medicine and 4-Digit Diagnostic Code approaches. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive history and physical and neurobehavioural assessments; a multidisciplinary approach is necessary. These are the first Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis of FAS and its related disabilities, developed by broad-based consultation among experts in diagnosis.","Children's Hospital, Health Sciences Centre, Department of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Man.",2005,NA
307,,15730354,Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trials (CREST): lessons learned.,"AIMS: The Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trials (CREST) were designed by the National Institute on Drug Abuse Division of Treatment Research and Development (NIDA, DT R&amp;D) to rapidly screen a number of medications potentially useful for the treatment of cocaine dependence.DESIGN: Each CREST trial was designed to compare several medications in a single trial against an unmatched placebo. The placebo group was included in each trial to avoid the nearly universal positive response to medications seen in open-label trials. In addition, a common set of procedures and outcome measures were employed throughout to increase comparability of results obtained from different trials and from different times.PARTICIPANTS: In all, 18 medications were screened in seven different trials, conducted in four different sites throughout the United States involving 398 cocaine-dependent patients.FINDINGS: Three medications were found to be promising enough to include in subsequent larger trials. Common statistical procedures for evaluating medications were developed to facilitate comparisons across sites and across time. A portion of the data were pooled and analyzed, which yielded some useful insights into cocaine dependence and its treatment. Finally, a review of individual trials together with the pooled analysis revealed several potential improvements for future screening trials.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the CREST trials proved to be useful for rapidly screening medications for treatment of cocaine dependence, but several modifications in design should be made before this framework is applied further.","Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Philadelphia, PA, USA. kampman_k@mail.trc.upenn.edu",2005,NA

On the basis of meta-analysis, an invitation to attend screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.45 to 0.74]). A meta-analysis of 3 trials revealed no significant difference in all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.95 to 1.02]). No significant reduction in AAA-related mortality was found in 1 study of AAA screening in women. Screening does not appear to be associated with significant physical or psychological harms. Major treatment harms include an operative mortality rate of 2% to 6% and significant risk for major complications.LIMITATIONS: The population screening studies focused on men and provided no information on racial or ethnic groups. No information was available on uninvited control group characteristics, so the importance of risk factors such as tobacco use or family history could not be assessed. Since all trials were conducted in countries other than the United States, generalizability to the U.S. population is uncertain.CONCLUSION: For men age 65 to 75 years, an invitation to attend AAA screening reduces AAA-related mortality.","Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center and Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon 97227, USA.",2005,NA
310,,23074460,Bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct an evidence-based analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery.BACKGROUND: Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2).() Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary incontinence. It is also associated with depression, and cancers of the breast, uterus, prostate, and colon, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Obesity is also associated with higher all-cause mortality at any age, even after adjusting for potential confounding factors like smoking. A person with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) has about a 50% higher risk of dying than does someone with a healthy BMI. The risk more than doubles at a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). An expert estimated that about 160,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. In the United States, the prevalence of morbid obesity is 4.7% (1999-2000). In Ontario, the 2004 Chief Medical Officer of Health Report said that in 2003, almost one-half of Ontario adults were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2)). About 57% of Ontario men and 42% of Ontario women were overweight or obese. The proportion of the population that was overweight or obese increased gradually from 44% in 1990 to 49% in 2000, and it appears to have stabilized at 49% in 2003. The report also noted that the tendency to be overweight and obese increases with age up to 64 years. BMI should be used cautiously for people aged 65 years and older, because the &quot;normal&quot; range may begin at slightly above 18.5 kg/m(2) and extend into the &quot;overweight&quot; range. The Chief Medical Officer of Health cautioned that these data may underestimate the true extent of the problem, because they were based on self reports, and people tend to over-report their height and under-report their weight. The actual number of Ontario adults who are overweight or obese may be higher. Diet, exercise, and behavioural therapy are used to help people lose weight. The goals of behavioural therapy are to identify, monitor, and alter behaviour that does not help weight loss. Techniques include self-monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress management, stimulus control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, contingency management, and identifying and using social support. Relapse, when people resume old, unhealthy behaviour and then regain the weight, can be problematic. Drugs (including gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and appetite suppressants) may be used if behavioural interventions fail. However, estimates of efficacy may be confounded by high rates of noncompliance, in part owing to the side effects of the drugs. In addition, the drugs have not been approved for indefinite use, despite the chronic nature of obesity.THE TECHNOLOGY: Morbidly obese people may be eligible for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. There are various bariatric surgical procedures and several different variations for each of these procedures. The surgical interventions can be divided into 2 general types: malabsorptive (bypassing parts of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food), and restrictive (decreasing the size of the stomach so that the patient is satiated with less food). All of these may be performed as either open surgery or laparoscopically. An example of a malabsorptive technique is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Examples of restrictive techniques are vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and adjustable gastric banding (AGB). The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services includes fee code &quot;S120 gastric bypass or partition, for morbid obesity&quot; as an insured service. The term gastric bypass is a general term that encompasses a variety of surgical methods, all of which involve reconfiguring the digestive system. The term gastric bypass does not include AGB. The number of gastric bypass procedures funded and done in Ontario, and funded as actual out-of-country approvals,() is shown below. Number of Gastric Bypass Procedures by Fiscal Year: Ontario and Actual Out-of-Country (OOC) ApprovalsData from Provider Services, MOHLTCCourtesy of Provider Services, Ministry of Health and Long Term CareREVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to treat morbid obesity. It used its standard search strategy to retrieve international health technology assessments and English-language journal articles from selected databases. The interventions of interest were bariatric surgery and, for the controls, either optimal conventional management or another type of bariatric procedure. The outcomes of interest were improvement in comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension); short- and long-term weight loss; quality of life; adverse effects; and economic analysis data. The databases yielded 15 international health technology assessments or systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Subsequently, the Medical Advisory Secretariat searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from April 2004 to December 2004, after the search cut-off date of April, 2004, for the most recent systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. One of those 10 was the Swedish Obese Subjects study, which started as a registry and intervention study, and then published findings on people who had been enrolled for at least 2 years or at least 10 years. In addition to the literature review of economic analysis data, the Medical Advisory Secretariat also did an Ontario-based economic analysis.SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Bariatric surgery generally is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions (including diabetes, high lipid levels, and hypertension). It also is effective at resolving the associated comorbid conditions. This conclusion is largely based on level 3a evidence from the prospectively designed Swedish Obese Subjects study, which recently published 10-year outcomes for patients who had bariatric surgery compared with patients who received nonsurgical treatment. (1)Regarding specific procedures, there is evidence that malabsorptive techniques are better than other banding techniques for weight loss and resolution of comorbid illnesses. However, there are no published prospective, long-term, direct comparisons of these techniques available.Surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, and drugs. In the absence of direct comparisons of active nonsurgical intervention via caloric restriction with bariatric techniques, the following observations are made:A recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal, except for one trial on Weight Watchers. Furthermore, the programs were associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years. (2)A recent randomized controlled trial reported 1-year outcomes comparing weight loss and metabolic changes in severely obese patients assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a conventional weight loss diet. At 1 year, weight loss was similar for patients in each group (mean, 2-5 kg). There was a favourable effect on triglyceride levels and glycemic control in the low-carbohydrate diet group. (3)A decision-analysis model showed bariatric surgery results in increased life expectancy in morbidly obese patients when compared to diet and exercise. (4)A cost-effectiveness model showed bariatric surgery is cost-effective relative to nonsurgical management. (5)Extrapolating from 2003 data from the United States, Ontario would likely need to do 3,500 bariatric surgeries per year. It currently does 508 per year, including out-of-country surgeries.",NA,2005,NA
311,,15607286,A meta-analysis of .08 BAC laws in 19 jurisdictions in the United States.,"More than a dozen studies on the effectiveness of the .08 blood alcohol concentration (BAC) laws have been published; however, those studies have varied both in the statistical methods and the type of outcome measure used, so it is difficult to integrate the findings into an overall estimate of the effectiveness of the law. This study used a consistent outcome measure, drinking drivers in fatal crashes and an identical methodology time-series analysis, to analyze the introduction of the .08 law in 18 states and the District of Columbia from 1982 to 2000. Each analysis accounted for other key safety laws (administrative license suspension/revocation and safety belt laws), as well as economic conditions that might influence the effectiveness of the .08 law. This provided 19 independent evaluations in which the effectiveness (treatment effect) of the law could be measured in the same quantitative terms. The number of drinking drivers in fatal crashes declined in 16 of the 19 jurisdictions after the .08 law was adopted. Nine of the 16 reductions were statistically significant (p &lt; .05). The effect size combined across all 19 locations showed statistically significant decline (p &lt; .005) of 14.8% in the rate of drinking drivers in fatal crashes after the .08 laws were introduced. The reduction was greater in states that had an administrative license suspension/revocation law and implemented frequent sobriety checkpoints. This analysis suggests that 947 lives might have been saved, had all 50 states and the District of Columbia had the .08 law throughout the year 2000.","Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, 11710 Beltsville Dr., Suite 300, Calverton, MD 20705, USA. tippetts@pire.org",2004,NA
