BTI - Screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Using Spirometry: Summary of 
      the Evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death
      in the United States. Fewer than half of the estimated 24 million Americans with 
      airflow obstruction have received a COPD diagnosis, and diagnosis often occurs in
      advanced stages of the disease. To summarize the evidence on screening for COPD
      using spirometry for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF).
      English-language articles identified in PubMed and the Cochrane Library through
      January 2007, recent systematic reviews, expert suggestions, and reference lists 
      of retrieved articles. Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for
      each of the 8 key questions on benefits and harms of screening. Eligible study
      types varied by question. Data Extraction: Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and
      rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria. Pharmacologic treatments
      for COPD reduce acute exacerbations in patients with severe disease. However,
      severe COPD is uncommon in the general U.S. population. Spirometry has not been
      shown to independently improve smoking cessation rates. Potential harms from
      screening include false-positive results and adverse effects from subsequent
      unnecessary therapy. Data on the prevalence of airflow obstruction in the U.S.
      population were used to calculate projected outcomes from screening groups
      defined by age and smoking status. No studies provide direct evidence on health
      outcomes associated with screening for COPD. Screening for COPD using spirometry 
      is likely to identify a predominance of patients with mild to moderate airflow
      obstruction who would not experience additional health benefits if labeled as
      having COPD. Hundreds of patients would need to undergo spirometry to defer a
      single exacerbation.

BTI - Screening in Primary Care Settings for Illicit Drug Use: Staged Systematic Review
      for the United States Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - Illicit drug use and abuse are serious problems among adolescents, adults, and
      pregnant women in the United States, and approximately 3.2% of the population age
      12 and over meet criteria for a drug use disorder. Many individuals with drug use
      disorders have co-existing mental and physical health conditions. To update the
      1996 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation on screening for
      drug misuse in primary care. The USPSTF previously concluded there was
      insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for drug
      misuse. This report describes a staged, systematic review that assessed whether
      the evidence for selected critical key questions is now sufficient for the USPSTF
      to make a recommendation on this topic. Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane 
      Database of Systematic Reviews, from 1994 through April 2006. Literature searches
      were supplemented with materials recommended by experts in the field and from
      reference lists in included articles. We developed an analytic framework and
      identified five critical key questions (KQ) to examine evidence sufficiency in a 
      causal chain linking primary care screening for drug misuse to treatment outcomes
      and longer-term health benefits of reductions in illicit drug use. We focused on 
      the most prevalent and/or harmful substances: illicit opiates, cocaine, and
      cannabis. Using inclusion/exclusion criteria specific to each critical KQ, we
      reviewed a total of 4587 abstracts for all key questions and 41 full-text
      articles for inclusion regarding direct evidence of health benefits of drug
      screening programs in primary care, 127 articles for inclusion regarding drug
      misuse treatment outcomes in primary care-screened populations, and 79 articles
      for inclusion regarding improvements in health or mortality following reduction
      in or cessation of illicit drug use. Inclusion criteria for drug misuse treatment
      articles required randomized controlled or controlled trial designs comparing a
      treatment to placebo or minimal treatment control; comparative effectiveness
      trials were excluded. Using USPSTF and other published methods, we critically
      appraised studies using quality criteria specific to their design. We listed
      studies excluded from analysis and rationales for their exclusion. We abstracted,
      critically appraised, and synthesized 28 articles meeting our criteria for all
      critical KQs. Abstracted elements were arrayed in evidence tables, using
      abstraction criteria specific to each KQ. We qualitatively summarized the
      findings, with an emphasis on the best available evidence for each critical KQ
      and the overall coherence of the evidence. We found no evidence addressing the
      effects on health outcomes of screening in primary care settings to identify and 
      treat drug misuse among asymptomatic individuals. We found no evidence that drug 
      misuse treatment affects health outcomes among individuals screened in primary
      care, and found little qualifying evidence in non-screened (treatment-seeking)
      populations. We found fair to good evidence that various drug misuse
      treatments-including pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions-effectively
      reduce opiate, cocaine, or marijuana misuse. All but one of the 17 included drug 
      misuse treatment trials were conducted among treatment-seeking, instead of
      primary-care-screened populations. The exception was a brief motivational
      intervention that reduced cocaine and opiate use among primary care patients
      identified through screening for use of these substances. We found less
      consistent evidence of drug misuse treatment effects on social and legal
      outcomes, although behavioral counseling interventions for cannabis misuse appear
      to reduce cannabis-related problems. We found fair evidence that stopping or
      reducing drug misuse is related to reduced mortality and morbidity, although none
      of this evidence was derived from individuals screened for drug misuse in primary
      care settings. Although many advances in drug misuse treatment have occurred
      during the past decade, the vast majority of trials have been conducted among
      treatment-seeking populations, and thus the relevance of outcomes from such
      studies is of uncertain applicability to asymptomatic primary care populations
      that could be screened for drug misuse. Evidence that reducing or stopping drug
      misuse is associated with improved health outcomes similarly derives from
      non-screened or treatment-seeking populations, and the generalizability of these 
      findings to general primary care populations may be limited.

BTI - Postmenopausal Hormone Replacement Therapy and Cardiovascular Disease
AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among women in the
      United States (US), and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is commonly used, often
      for the prevention of CVD. The goal of this systematic evidence review and
      meta-analysis is to evaluate the association between HRT and the primary
      prevention of CVD, including total CVD, coronary artery disease (CAD), and
      stroke, when they were evaluated as separate subsets. The MEDLINE (1966-2000) and
      Cochrane databases were searched for all published studies reporting CVD, CAD,
      and stroke incidence and/or mortality in association with HRT among the general
      population of women; reference lists, letters, editorials, and reviews were also 
      reviewed. All studies were reviewed, abstracted and rated in quality; only
      studies of good or fair quality according to U.S. Preventive Services Task Force 
      (USPSTF) criteria were included in the detailed review and meta-analysis.
      Meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. The summary relative
      risk for CVD mortality with any HRT use was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.42-1.23) and for
      current users was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44-0.93). CAD mortality was associated with a
      relative risk of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.36-1.45) for any use and 0.62 (95% CI,
      0.40-0.91) for current use. No significant association between HRT and risk of
      stroke death was identified. In contrast to the mortality findings, the summary
      relative risk for CVD incidence is 1.28 (95% CI, 0.86-2.00) for any use and 1.27 
      (95% CI, 0.80-2.00) for current use. Stroke incidence was significantly increased
      among women using HRT, with a summary relative risk of 1.12 (95% CI 1.01-1.23),
      largely due to a significant increase in atherothrombotic stroke among women
      using HRT. In our meta-analysis, the pooled relative risk of CAD associated with 
      any use of HRT was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.62-1.21) and for current use was 0.80 (95% CI,
      0.68-0.95). When studies adjust for socioeconomic status (SES) as well as other
      major CAD risk factors, the summary relative risk of CAD is 0.97 (95% CI,
      0.82-1.16) among current users and 1.04 (95% CI, 0.79-1.44) among ever users.
      Similar results were found when the analysis stratified by studies adjusting for 
      alcohol consumption and/or exercise, in addition to other major risk factors. The
      association between HRT and CVD incidence and mortality, as well as CAD and
      stroke incidence and mortality, is uncertain, based on conflicting findings, and 
      limited by lack of randomization and consequent selection biases among women
      using HRT in the observational studies. Our meta-analysis differs from prior
      meta-analyses by evaluating potential explanatory variables of the HRT-CVD/CAD
      relationship, as well as different measures of HRT exposure. It shows a small
      decrease in CVD and CAD deaths only among current HRT users and no effect on
      stroke, and suggests that SES, alcohol use, and exercise are important
      confounders of the HRT/CVD/CAD relationship. A valid answer to the potential role
      of HRT in the primary prevention of CVD will best come from randomized controlled
      trials.

TI  - Adolescent gambling: a review of an emerging field of research.
PG  - 223-36
LID - 10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.05.003 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was to summarize the research on adolescent
      gambling with implications for research and prevention or intervention. METHOD:
      The methodology involved a comprehensive and systematic search of "adolescent or 
      youth gambling" in three diverse electronic databases (MedlineAdvanced, PsycINFO,
      and Sociological Abstracts) and three peer-reviewed journals (International
      Journal of Gambling Studies, International Journal of Mental Health and
      Addiction, and Journal of Gambling Issues). RESULTS: The search resulted in 137
      articles (1985-2010) focusing on gambling among youth aged between 9 and 21
      years: 103 quantitative, 8 qualitative, and 26 non-empirical. The study of
      adolescent gambling can be summarized as follows: (a) it is conducted by a
      relatively small group of researchers in Britain, Canada, and the United States; 
      (b) it is primarily prevalence-focused, quantitative, descriptive, school-based, 
      and atheoretical; (c) it has most often been published in the Journal of Gambling
      Studies; (d) it is most often examined in relation to alcohol use; (e) it has
      relatively few valid and reliable screening instruments that are developmentally 
      appropriate for adolescents, and (f) it lacks racially diverse samples.
      CONCLUSION: Four recommendations are presented for both research and prevention
      or intervention which are as follows: (1) to provide greater attention to the
      development and validation of survey instruments or diagnostic criteria to assess
      adolescent problem gambling; (2) to begin to develop and test more gambling
      prevention or intervention strategies; (3) to not only examine the co-morbidity
      of gambling and alcohol abuse, but also include other behaviors such as sexual
      activity; and (4) to pay greater attention to racial and ethnic differences in
      the study of adolescent gambling.

TI  - A brief motivational interview in a pediatric emergency department, plus 10-day
      telephone follow-up, increases attempts to quit drinking among youth and young
      adults who screen positive for problematic drinking.
PG  - 890-902

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adolescents in their late teens and early 20s have the highest
      alcohol consumption in the United States; binge drinking peaks at age 21-25
      years. Underage drinking is associated with many negative consequences, including
      academic problems and risk of intentional and unintentional injuries. This study 
      tested the effectiveness of pediatric emergency department (PED) screening and
      brief intervention to reduce alcohol consumption and associated risks. METHODS: A
      three-group randomized assignment trial was structured to test differences
      between intervention (I) and standard assessed control (AC) groups in alcohol
      consumption and alcohol-related behaviors from baseline to 12 months and to
      compare the AC group with a minimally assessed control (MAC) group to adjust for 
      the effect of assessment reactivity on control group behavior. Patients aged
      14-21 years were eligible if they screened positive on the Alcohol Use Disorders 
      Identification Test (AUDIT) or for binge drinking or high-risk behaviors. The MAC
      group received a resource handout, written advice about alcohol-related risks,
      and a 12-month follow-up appointment. Patients in the AC group were assessed
      using standardized instruments in addition to the MAC protocol. The I group
      received a peer-conducted motivational intervention, referral to community
      resources and treatment if indicated, and a 10-day booster in addition to
      assessment. Measurements included 30-day self-report of alcohol consumption and
      alcohol-related behaviors, screens for depression and posttraumatic stress
      disorder, and self-report of attempts to quit, cut back, or change conditions of 
      use, all repeated at follow-up. Motor vehicle records and medical records were
      also analyzed for changes from baseline to 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: Among 7,807
      PED patients screened, 1,202 were eligible; 853 enrolled (I, n = 283; AC, n =
      284; MAC, n = 286), with a 12-month follow-up rate of 72%. At 12 months, more
      than half of enrollees in Reaching Adolescents for Prevention (RAP) attempted to 
      cut back on drinking, and over a third tried to quit. A significantly larger
      proportion of the I group made efforts to quit drinking and to be careful about
      situations when drinking compared to AC enrollees, and there was a numerically
      but not significantly greater likelihood (p = 0.065) among the I group for
      efforts to cut back on drinking. At 3 months, the likelihood of the I group
      making attempts to cut back was almost triple that of ACs. For efforts to quit,
      it was double, and for trying to be careful about situations when drinking, there
      was a 72% increase in the odds ratio (OR) for the I group. Three-month results
      for attempts were sustained at 12 months for quit attempts and efforts to be
      careful. Consumption declined in both groups from baseline to 3 months to 12
      months, but there were no significant between-group differences in
      alcohol-related consequences at 12 months or in alcohol-related risk behaviors.
      We found a pattern suggestive of assessment reactivity in only one variable at 12
      months: the attempt to cut back (73.3% for the I group vs. 64.9% among the AC
      group and 54.8% among the MAC group). CONCLUSIONS: Brief motivational
      intervention resulted in significant efforts to change behavior (quit drinking
      and be careful about situations while drinking) but did not alter between-group
      consumption or consequences.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of baclofen for alcohol dependence: a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1849-57
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01273.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials and case-reports indicate that baclofen, a
      GABA(B) agonist, may have efficacy for alcohol dependence. Baclofen has been
      shown to enhance abstinence, to reduce drinking quantity, to reduce craving, and 
      to reduce anxiety in alcohol-dependent individuals in 2 placebo-controlled trials
      in Italy. However, the clinical trial data with baclofen is limited. The purpose 
      of the present study was to test the efficacy and tolerability of baclofen in
      alcohol dependence in the United States. METHODS: The study was a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, randomized study comparing 30 mg/d of baclofen to placebo
      over 12 weeks of treatment and utilizing 8 sessions of BRENDA, a low-intensity
      psychosocial intervention. One hundred and twenty-one subjects were screened to
      yield 80 randomized subjects (44 men) with randomization balanced for gender.
      Percent heavy drinking days was the primary outcome measure with other drinking
      outcomes, anxiety levels, and craving as secondary outcomes. Tolerability was
      examined. RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of subjects completed the study. No
      difference by drug condition was seen in percentage of heavy drinking days where 
      on-average rates were 25.5% (+/-23.6%) for placebo and 25.9% (+/-23.2%) for
      baclofen during treatment (t(73)=0.59, p=0.56). Similarly, no differences were
      seen by drug condition in percentage of days abstinent, time to first drink, or
      time to relapse to heavy drinking. Baclofen was associated with a significant
      reduction in state anxiety (F(1,73)= 5.39, p=0.02). Baclofen was well tolerated
      with only 2 individuals stopping baclofen because of adverse events. There were
      no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist, represents a
      possible new pharmacotherapeutic approach to alcohol dependence. Despite
      encouraging preclinical data and prior positive clinical trials with baclofen in 
      Italy, the current trial did not find evidence that baclofen is superior to
      placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence. Additional clinical trial work is
      necessary to establish whether baclofen does or does not have therapeutic
      efficacy in alcohol dependence and, if it does, what factors are predictive of
      response.

TI  - Health status and health maintenance practices among doctors and nurses at two
      hospitals in Jamaica.
PG  - 539-45
AB  - The health of doctors and nurses is of paramount importance because they must be 
      well to perform their jobs optimally under difficult conditions. However, the
      challenge of their working environment and the culture of their professions often
      lead to physical and mental illnesses. Despite this, there are several barriers
      to doctors and nurses seeking healthcare. In this study, the health status and
      health maintenance practices of doctors and nurses at two hospitals in Kingston, 
      Jamaica, were assessed. This population was previously reported to have a 27%
      prevalence of probable mental distress based on the General Health Questionnaire 
      30 (GHQ30). Two hundred and twelve doctors and nurses were recruited into the
      study. The reported prevalence of chronic diseases was determined while mental
      health status was based on the GHQ30, reported signs and symptoms of stress and
      job satisfaction. Health maintenance practices studied included, health-seeking
      behaviour willingness to seek counselling, reported source of emotional support
      and use of alcohol and tobacco as coping strategies. Although, less than 50% of
      study participants reported that they were satisfied with their job, the mean
      number of days missed from work in the "last six months" was less than two and a 
      half days. The mean time for "last doctor's visit" for nurses and doctors in the 
      current study were 0.93 and 2.4 years, respectively. Females were more willing to
      seek medical attention than males. More than 50% reported signs and symptoms of
      stress and major sources of emotional support were friends (55.7%), followed by
      spouses (36.0%) and colleagues (12.3%). The prevalence of chronic diseases was
      less than 1% and alcohol and tobacco did not appear to be major coping
      strategies. The population appeared to be physically healthy and despite the
      known prevalence of probable mental distress, doctors and nurses appeared
      unwilling to seek healthcare. Probable barriers to seeking healthcare included
      confidentiality issues and the need to appear healthy to colleagues, patients and
      the community.

TI  - National survey of pediatricians' opinions about and practices for acute otitis
      media and xylitol use.
PG  - 329-46
LID - 10.3766/jaaa.21.5.5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the main reason for physician visits and 
      antibiotic prescriptions in children. Pediatricians (Peds) are gatekeepers for
      services and sources of information for families. The 2004 American Academy of
      Pediatrics/American Academy of Family Physicians (AAP/AAFP) Clinical Practice
      Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media recommended
      preventative and management measures for Peds' practice. Treatments for AOM
      (antimicrobial therapy and surgery) sometimes have questionable effectiveness,
      risks, and high costs. Thus, Peds should consider using prophylactics for AOM
      that are easy to administer, cost-effective, and have minimal side effects.
      Xylitol, a naturally occurring sugar alcohol, is widely used to prevent AOM and
      for other health conditions in Europe, and as a dental caries prophylaxis in the 
      United States. It would be helpful to know Peds' attitudes and practices to
      identify barriers to xylitol's use as a prophylaxis for AOM in the United States.
      PURPOSE: To conduct a national survey of Peds in the United States to evaluate
      how closely they adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline, and their knowledge and
      opinions about xylitol use. RESEARCH DESIGN: A randomized, national postal
      survey. METHOD: A 48-item questionnaire developed for this study was mailed to a 
      random sample of 506 Peds within the United States during spring 2009. It
      assessed Peds' demographics, adherence to the guideline, and knowledge and
      opinions about and use of xylitol as a prophylaxis for AOM in children. RESULTS: 
      The questionnaire response rate was 22% (98 useable/506 mailed - 63 returned
      undeliverable). Participants were about equal for gender, and almost all were in 
      private practice for over 10 yr. Most had pediatric patients with at least one
      bout of AOM annually. The majority adhered to the guideline (e.g., almost all
      routinely assessed and managed patients' pain for AOM and encouraged prevention
      by recommending that families reduce risk factors). Most used and were
      comfortable with otoscopy for diagnosing AOM, but not tympanometry. Almost all
      believed that conductive hearing loss could hinder speech-language and academic
      development, and AOM could reduce quality of life of children. They also believed
      that those under 6 mo of age with AOM should receive antibacterial therapy
      beginning with amoxicillin but did not use complementary and alternative medicine
      (CAM). Only about half knew about medical uses for xylitol, but of those, most
      were aware of its use in chewing gum to prevent AOM but had not used it with
      patients. They were not sure of xylitol's effectiveness or appropriate dosages
      but cited stomach cramping and diarrhea as possible side effects. Most would use 
      xylitol if evidence supported it and wanted information about it via reprints or 
      electronically. Few agreed that audiologists are important in diagnosing/managing
      AOM. CONCLUSIONS: Most of these Peds adhered to the AAP/AAFP guideline. They were
      not using CAMs like xylitol for preventing AOM in children. Future research
      should focus on prevention and the use of xylitol as a possible prophylaxis
      regimen for AOM in patients.

TI  - Prevalence of mental health problems and functional impairment among active
      component and National Guard soldiers 3 and 12 months following combat in Iraq.
PG  - 614-23
LID - 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2010.54 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: A growing body of literature has demonstrated the association of combat 
      in Iraq and Afghanistan with postdeployment mental health problems, particularly 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, studies have shown 
      varying prevalence rates of these disorders based on different case definitions
      and have not assessed functional impairment, alcohol misuse, or aggressive
      behavior as comorbid factors occurring with PTSD and depression. OBJECTIVES: To
      (1) examine the prevalence rates of depression and PTSD using several case
      definitions including functional impairment, (2) determine the comorbidity of
      alcohol misuse or aggressive behaviors with depression or PTSD, and (3) compare
      rates between Active Component and National Guard soldiers at the 3- and 12-month
      time points following their deployment to Iraq. DESIGN: Population-based,
      cross-sectional study. SETTING: United States Army posts and National Guard
      armories. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 18 305 US Army soldiers from 4 Active
      Component and 2 National Guard infantry brigade combat teams. INTERVENTIONS:
      Between 2004 and 2007, anonymous mental health surveys were collected at 3 and 12
      months following deployment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Current PTSD, depression,
      functional impairment, alcohol misuse, and aggressive behavior. RESULTS:
      Prevalence rates for PTSD or depression with serious functional impairment ranged
      between 8.5% and 14.0%, with some impairment between 23.2% and 31.1%. Alcohol
      misuse or aggressive behavior comorbidity was present in approximately half of
      the cases. Rates remained stable for the Active Component soldiers but increased 
      across all case definitions from the 3- to 12-month time point for National Guard
      soldiers. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence rates of PTSD and depression after
      returning from combat ranged from 9% to 31% depending on the level of functional 
      impairment reported. The high comorbidity with alcohol misuse and aggression
      highlights the need for comprehensive postdeployment screening. Persistent or
      increased prevalence rates at 12 months compared with 3 months postdeployment
      illustrate the persistent effects of war zone service and provide important data 
      to guide postdeployment care.

TI  - Binge drinking and suboptimal self-rated health among adult drinkers.
PG  - 1465-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2010.01231.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Binge drinking accounts for more than half of the 79,000 annual
      deaths in the United States that are owing to excessive drinking. The overall
      objective of our study was to examine the prevalence of binge drinking and
      consumption levels associated with suboptimal self-rated health among the general
      population of adult drinkers in all 50 states and territories in the United
      States. METHODS: The study included a total of 200,587 current drinkers who
      participated in the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
      survey. We estimated the prevalence of binge drinking (i.e., > or =5 drinks on 1 
      occasion for men or > or =4 drinks on 1 occasion for women) and heavy drinking
      (i.e., an average of >14 drinks per week for men or >7 drinks per week for
      women), as well as the average number of binge episodes per person during a
      30-day period. Odds ratios were produced with multivariate logistic regression
      models using binge-drinking levels as a predictor; status of suboptimal
      self-rated health was used as an outcome variable while controlling for
      sociodemographic, health, and behavioral risk factors. RESULTS: We estimate that 
      34.7 million adult drinkers in the United States engaged in binge drinking in
      2008, including an estimated 42.2% who reported either heavy drinking or at least
      4 binge-drinking episodes in a 30-day period. Binge drinking with such levels was
      associated with a 13-23% increased likelihood of reporting suboptimal self-rated 
      health, when compared to the nonbinge drinkers. CONCLUSIONS: Binge drinking
      continues to be a serious public health concern. Frequent binge drinkers or binge
      drinkers who consume alcohol heavily are especially at risk of suboptimal
      self-rated health. Our findings underscore the importance of broad-based
      implementation in health care settings of screening for and brief interventions
      to address alcohol misuse, as well as the continuing need to implement effective 
      population-based prevention strategies to reduce alcohol-related morbidity and
      mortality.

TI  - The 2010 Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations for the
      management of hypertension: part 2 - therapy.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To update the evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and
      treatment of hypertension in adults for 2010. OPTIONS AND OUTCOMES: For lifestyle
      and pharmacological interventions, randomized trials and systematic reviews of
      trials were preferentially reviewed. Changes in cardiovascular morbidity and
      mortality were the primary outcomes of interest. However, for lifestyle
      interventions, blood pressure lowering was accepted as a primary outcome given
      the general lack of long-term morbidity and mortality data in this field.
      Progressive renal impairment was also accepted as a clinically relevant primary
      outcome among patients with chronic kidney disease. EVIDENCE: A Cochrane
      Collaboration librarian conducted an independent MEDLINE search from 2008 to
      August 2009 to update the 2009 recommendations. To identify additional studies,
      reference lists were reviewed and experts were contacted. All relevant articles
      were reviewed and appraised independently by both content and methodological
      experts using prespecified levels of evidence. RECOMMENDATIONS: For lifestyle
      modifications to prevent and treat hypertension, restrict dietary sodium to 1500 
      mg (65 mmol) per day in adults 50 years of age or younger, to 1300 mg (57 mmol)
      per day in adults 51 to 70 years of age, and to 1200 mg (52 mmol) per day in
      adults older than 70 years of age; perform 30 min to 60 min of moderate aerobic
      exercise four to seven days per week; maintain a healthy body weight (body mass
      index 18.5 kg/m(2) to 24.9 kg/m(2)) and waist circumference (less than 102 cm for
      men and less than 88 cm for women); limit alcohol consumption to no more than 14 
      standard drinks per week for men or nine standard drinks per week for women;
      follow a diet that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products,
      dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources, and that 
      is low in saturated fat and cholesterol; and consider stress management in
      selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of
      hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on the
      patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid
      conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to less than 140/90 mmHg in all
      patients, and to less than 130/80 mmHg in patients with diabetes mellitus or
      chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve
      these target blood pressures. Antihypertensive therapy should be considered in
      all adult patients regardless of age (caution should be exercised in elderly
      patients who are frail). For adults without compelling indications for other
      agents, considerations for initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics,
      angiotensin- converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in patients who are not black), 
      long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
      or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two
      first-line agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if 
      systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is
      10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be
      used, unless compelling indications are present to suggest consideration of dual 
      therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic
      hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or
      ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or
      betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with
      cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in
      patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or
      ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with
      diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria,
      thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In
      selected high-risk patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an
      ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE
      inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia
      should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the
      Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do
      not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for
      cardiovascular events, should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood
      pressure is controlled, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be
      considered. VALIDATION: All recommendations were graded according to the strength
      of the evidence and voted on by the 63 members of the Canadian Hypertension
      Education Program Evidence-Based Recommendations Task Force. All recommendations 
      reported here achieved at least 80% consensus. These guidelines will continue to 
      be updated annually. SPONSORS: The Canadian Hypertension Education Program
      process is sponsored by the Canadian Hypertension Society, Blood Pressure Canada,
      the Public Health Agency of Canada, the College of Family Physicians of Canada,
      the Canadian Pharmacists Association, the Canadian Council of Cardiovascular
      Nurses, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

TI  - Advancing bipolar disorder: key lessons from the Systematic Treatment Enhancement
      Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD).
PG  - 136-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the overall clinical research findings from the Systematic
      Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), the world's largest
      study of BD. METHODS: STEP-BD was conducted from 1998 to 2005, enrolling
      participants (n = 4361) across 22 clinical sites in the United States. Each
      individual was followed for up to 2 years in naturalistic practice with blinded
      research assessments, while subgroups participated in randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) for bipolar depression. The naturalistic database was used to
      examine the course of BD, comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, and
      suicidality. Relevant studies in English, published from January 1, 1994, to May 
      31, 2009, were identified using computerized searches of electronic databases
      (PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Register of Clinical Trials), inspection of
      bibliographies, and review of other major reports. RESULTS: One large RCT
      involving the addition of either paroxetine or bupropion to mood stabilizers in
      acute depression found neither more effective than placebo in achieving sustained
      recovery (8 weeks of euthymia). A second large RCT found intensive psychosocial
      interventions superior to a brief psychosocial intervention as an adjunct to
      medication in acute depression. A third small RCT found minimal effects of
      lamotrigine, risperidone, or inositol in refractory depression. Recovery was
      difficult to achieve, with subsyndromal symptoms or full relapse very common.
      Anxiety disorders and smoking in particular were treatable conditions that
      adversely affected the course of BD. CONCLUSIONS: STEP-BD yielded numerous
      clinical and systems observations that provide fresh direction for research and
      treatment of BD, including setting new benchmarks for outcome and demonstrating
      the viability of large BD networks.

      study.
PG  - 1100-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.02900.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine the influence of risk perception on intentions to quit smoking
      and post-treatment abstinence. DESIGN: Prospective and longitudinal. SETTING:
      United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 237 adult smokers (mean age 56 years)
      receiving medical care from home health-care nurses. Participants did not have to
      want to quit smoking to participate, but received cessation counseling within the
      context of their medical care. MEASUREMENTS: Three measures of risk perception
      were given pre- and post-treatment: perceived vulnerability, optimistic bias and 
      precaution effectiveness. Smoking status was verified biochemically at end of
      treatment and at 2, 6 and 12 months later. FINDINGS: Principal components
      analysis supported the theoretical discriminability of the risk perception
      measures, and intercorrelations provided evidence for concurrent and predictive
      validity. Elevated risk perception was associated with a variety of
      socio-demographic and psychosocial characteristics. Optimistic bias was
      associated significantly with older age and ethnic minority status. Smokers in
      pre-contemplation had lower perceived vulnerability and precaution effectiveness 
      and greater optimistic bias than those in contemplation and preparation. Smokers 
      in preparation had higher perceived vulnerability and lower optimistic bias than 
      those in earlier stages. Change in perceived vulnerability predicted smoking
      cessation at follow-up. Optimistic bias predicted a lower likelihood of cessation
      and precaution effectiveness predicted a greater likelihood of smoking cessation,
      but only among those with a smoking-related illness. CONCLUSIONS: In patients
      receiving medical care from home health-care nurses, change in perceived
      vulnerability to smoking-related disease is predictive of smoking cessation. In
      those with smoking-related illnesses, optimistic bias predicts continued smoking 
      while precaution effectiveness predicts cessation.

TI  - Evidence of disparity in the application of quality improvement efforts for the
      treatment of acute myocardial infarction: the American College of Cardiology's
      Guidelines Applied in Practice Initiative in Michigan.
PG  - 377-84
LID - 10.1016/j.ahj.2009.12.014 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial disparities exist in the management of patients with
      cardiovascular disease in the United States. The aim of the study was to evaluate
      if a structured initiative for improving care of patients with acute myocardial
      infarction (Guidelines Applied in Practice [GAP]) led to comparable care of white
      and nonwhite patients admitted to GAP hospitals in Michigan. METHODS: Medicare
      patients comprised 2 cohorts: (1) those admitted before GAP implementation (n =
      1,368) and (2) those admitted after GAP implementation (n = 1,489). The main
      outcome measure was adherence to guideline-based medications/recommendations and 
      use of the GAP discharge tool. chi(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to
      determine differences between white patients (n = 2,367) and nonwhite patients (n
      = 490). RESULTS: In-hospital GAP tool and aspirin use significantly improved for 
      white and nonwhite patients. beta-Blocker use in hospital improved significantly 
      for nonwhite patients only (66% vs 83.3%; P = .04). At discharge, nonwhite
      patients were 28% and 64% less likely than white patients to have had the GAP
      discharge tool used (P = .004) and receive smoking cessation counseling (P <
      .001), respectively. Among white patients, GAP improved discharge prescription
      rates for aspirin by 10.8% (P < .001) and beta-blockers by 7.0% (P = .047).
      Nonwhite patients' aspirin prescriptions increased by 1.0% and beta-blocker
      prescriptions decreased by 6.0% (both P values nonsignificant). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      GAP program led to significant increases in rates of evidence-based care in both 
      white and nonwhite Medicare patients. However, nonwhite patients received less
      quality improvement discharge tool and smoking cessation counseling. Policies
      designed to reduce racial disparities in health care must address disparity in
      the delivery of quality improvement programs.

      a randomized trial.
PG  - 515-23
LID - 10.3109/00016341003678419 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the use of a Video Doctor plus provider cueing to 
      promote provider advice and smoking cessation outcomes in pregnancy. DESIGN: A
      randomized clinical trial was conducted from 2006 to 2008. SETTING: Five
      community prenatal clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area of the United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 410 pregnant patients completed screening for behavioral
      risks including tobacco use in the past 30 days. Pregnant smokers (n = 42) were
      randomized regardless of their intention to quit smoking. METHODS: Participants
      were assigned to either usual care or intervention. Intervention participants
      received 15-minute Video Doctor sessions plus provider cueing, at baseline and
      one month, prior to their routine prenatal visit. The Video Doctor delivered
      interactive tailored messages, an educational worksheet for participants, and a
      cueing sheet for providers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Receipt of advice from the
      provider and 30-day smoking abstinence, both by self-report. RESULTS:
      Intervention participants were more likely to receive provider advice on tobacco 
      use at both prenatal visits during the intervention period (60.9 vs. 15.8%, p =
      0.003). The intervention yielded a significantly greater decrease in the number
      of days smoked and in cigarettes smoked per day. The 30-day abstinence rate at
      two months post baseline was 2.5 times greater in the intervention group; the
      difference was not significant (26.1 vs. 10.5%, p = 0.12). CONCLUSIONS: The Video
      Doctor plus provider cueing is an efficacious adjunct to routine prenatal care by
      promoting provider advice and smoking reduction among pregnant smokers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous reviews have examined the existence of HIV prevention,
      treatment, and care services for injecting drug users (IDUs) worldwide, but they 
      did not quantify the scale of coverage. We undertook a systematic review to
      estimate national, regional, and global coverage of HIV services in IDUs.
      METHODS: We did a systematic search of peer-reviewed (Medline, BioMed Central),
      internet, and grey-literature databases for data published in 2004 or later. A
      multistage process of data requests and verification was undertaken, involving UN
      agencies and national experts. National data were obtained for the extent of
      provision of the following core interventions for IDUs: needle and syringe
      programmes (NSPs), opioid substitution therapy (OST) and other drug treatment,
      HIV testing and counselling, antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom programmes.
      We calculated national, regional, and global coverage of NSPs, OST, and ART on
      the basis of available estimates of IDU population sizes. FINDINGS: By 2009, NSPs
      had been implemented in 82 countries and OST in 70 countries; both interventions 
      were available in 66 countries. Regional and national coverage varied
      substantially. Australasia (202 needle-syringes per IDU per year) had by far the 
      greatest rate of needle-syringe distribution; Latin America and the Caribbean
      (0.3 needle-syringes per IDU per year), Middle East and north Africa (0.5
      needle-syringes per IDU per year), and sub-Saharan Africa (0.1 needle-syringes
      per IDU per year) had the lowest rates. OST coverage varied from less than or
      equal to one recipient per 100 IDUs in central Asia, Latin America, and
      sub-Saharan Africa, to very high levels in western Europe (61 recipients per 100 
      IDUs). The number of IDUs receiving ART varied from less than one per 100
      HIV-positive IDUs (Chile, Kenya, Pakistan, Russia, and Uzbekistan) to more than
      100 per 100 HIV-positive IDUs in six European countries. Worldwide, an estimated 
      two needle-syringes (range 1-4) were distributed per IDU per month, there were
      eight recipients (6-12) of OST per 100 IDUs, and four IDUs (range 2-18) received 
      ART per 100 HIV-positive IDUs. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide coverage of HIV
      prevention, treatment, and care services in IDU populations is very low. There is
      an urgent need to improve coverage of these services in this at-risk population.

TI  - Outcomes of laser thermal therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer.
PG  - 344-50
LID - 10.1016/j.otohns.2009.11.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the outcomes of a phase II study using laser-induced thermal
      therapy (LITT) as a palliative treatment for 106 patients with recurrent head and
      neck tumors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary hospital in the
      United States. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The primary endpoints were tumor response
      and survival. Prognostic values were assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
      RESULTS: The best results were seen in oral cavity tumors, in which mean survival
      was 29.1 months, as compared to neck tumors (mean 14.4 +/- 6.9 months; range
      7.5-20.7 months; with a 95% confidence interval). Further analysis showed that
      clinical factors such as gender, smoking, and alcohol use were not indicators of 
      poor prognosis, whereas neck disease and tumor stage at first treatment were
      relevant factors. CONCLUSION: In this study, 40 out of 106 patients treated by
      LITT remained alive at the end of our follow-up, and a complete response was seen
      in 24 (22.6%) patients. The highest response rate was seen in oral cavity tumors,
      which suggests that tumor location at this site may be a predictor of favorable
      outcome with LITT.

TI  - Risk factor profile for chronic non-communicable diseases: results of a
      community-based study in Kerala, India.
PG  - 53-63
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Kerala State is a harbinger of what will happen in
      future to the rest of India in chronic non-communicable diseases (NCD). We
      assessed: (i) the burden of NCD risk factors; (ii) estimated the relations of
      behavioural risk factors to socio-demographic correlates, anthropometric risk
      factors with behavioural risk factors; (iii) evaluated if socio-demographic,
      behavioural and anthropometric risk factors predicted biochemical risk factors;
      and (iv) estimated awareness, treatment and adequacy of control of hypertension
      and diabetes, in Kerala state. METHODS: A total of 7449 individuals (51% women)
      stratified by age group, sex and place of residence were selected and information
      on behavioural risk factors; tobacco use, diet, physical activity, alcohol use,
      measured anthropometry, blood pressure was collected. Fasting blood samples were 
      analysed for blood glucose, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
      cholesterol and triglycerides in a sample subset.Using multiple logistic
      regression models the associations between socio-demographic and anthropometric
      variables with biochemical risk factors were estimated. RESULTS: The burden of
      NCD risk factors was high in our sample. Prevalence of behavioural and each of
      the biochemical risk factors increased with age, adjusting for other factors
      including sex and the place of residence. The odds ratios relating anthropometric
      variables to biochemical variables were modest, suggesting that anthropometric
      variables may not be useful surrogates for biochemical risk factors for
      population screening purposes. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: In this large study 
      of community-based sample in Kerala, high burden of NCD risk factors was
      observed, comparable to that in the United States. These data may serve to propel
      multisectoral efforts to lower the community burden of NCD risk factors in India 
      in general, and in Kerala, in particular.

TI  - Brief physician advice for heavy drinking college students: a randomized
      controlled trial in college health clinics.
PG  - 23-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of brief physician
      advice in reducing alcohol use and related harm in college students. METHOD: The 
      College Health Intervention Projects (CHIPs) is a randomized, controlled clinical
      trial with 12-month follow-up conducted in five college health clinics in
      Wisconsin; Washington state; and Vancouver, Canada. Of the 12,900 students
      screened for high-risk drinking, 484 men and 502 women met inclusion criteria and
      were randomized into a control (n = 493) or intervention (n = 493) group.
      Ninety-six percent of students participated in the follow-up procedures. The
      intervention consisted of two 15-minute counseling visits and two follow-up phone
      calls, and used motivational interviewing, contracting, diary cards, and
      take-home exercises. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between
      groups at baseline on alcohol use, age, socioeconomic or smoking status, rates of
      depression, or measures of alcohol-related harm. At 12 months, the experimental
      subjects reduced their 28-day drinking totals by 27.2%, and the control group
      reduced their totals by 21%. A mixed effects repeated measures model found a
      statistical difference in favor of the brief-intervention group (beta = 4.7, SE =
      2.0, p = .018) in 28-day drinking totals. The total Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index
      score was also significantly different during the 12-month follow-up period (beta
      = 0.8, SE = 0.4, p = .033). There was no difference on the other outcome measures
      of interest, such as frequency of excessive heavy drinking, health care
      utilization, injuries, drunk driving, depression, or tobacco use. CONCLUSIONS:
      The study supports resource allocation and implementation of alcohol screening
      and brief physician advice in primary care-based college health clinics.

PG  - 223-7
LID - 10.3928/01484834-20091217-08 [doi]
AB  - A university nursing program in Ontario, Canada initiated the process of
      implementing the Registered Nurses' Association of Ontario best practice
      guideline (BPG) on smoking cessation into the curriculum. This study explored
      nursing students' and clinical instructors' perception of the BPG in their
      practice to support faculty in the development of a curriculum that promotes
      smoking cessation and the competencies necessary for graduates to implement
      health promotion skills in practice. Four student nurses and two clinical
      instructors participated in semistructured interviews. Four major themes were
      identified through the data analysis process: personal and professional self,
      health "preaching," developmental perspective and environmental constraints. This
      study presents a curricular model for health promotion practice incorporating the
      components of primary health care, health promotion counseling, smoking cessation
      BPG, and sociopolitical context.

TI  - Stenting for peripheral artery disease of the lower extremities: an
      evidence-based analysis.
PG  - 1-88
AB  - BACKGROUND: OBJECTIVE: In January 2010, the Medical Advisory Secretariat received
      an application from University Health Network to provide an evidentiary platform 
      on stenting as a treatment management for peripheral artery disease. The purpose 
      of this health technology assessment is to examine the effectiveness of primary
      stenting as a treatment management for peripheral artery disease of the lower
      extremities. CLINICAL NEED: CONDITION AND TARGET POPULATION Peripheral artery
      disease (PAD) is a progressive disease occurring as a result of plaque
      accumulation (atherosclerosis) in the arterial system that carries blood to the
      extremities (arms and legs) as well as vital organs. The vessels that are most
      affected by PAD are the arteries of the lower extremities, the aorta, the
      visceral arterial branches, the carotid arteries and the arteries of the upper
      limbs. In the lower extremities, PAD affects three major arterial segments i)
      aortic-iliac, ii) femoro-popliteal (FP) and iii) infra-popliteal (primarily
      tibial) arteries. The disease is commonly classified clinically as asymptomatic
      claudication, rest pain and critical ischemia. Although the prevalence of PAD in 
      Canada is not known, it is estimated that 800,000 Canadians have PAD. The 2007
      Trans Atlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC) II Working Group for the Management 
      of Peripheral Disease estimated that the prevalence of PAD in Europe and North
      America to be 27 million, of whom 88,000 are hospitalizations involving lower
      extremities. A higher prevalence of PAD among elderly individuals has been
      reported to range from 12% to 29%. The National Health and Nutrition Examination 
      Survey (NHANES) estimated that the prevalence of PAD is 14.5% among individuals
      70 years of age and over. Modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated
      with PAD include advanced age, male gender, family history, smoking, diabetes,
      hypertension and hyperlipidemia. PAD is a strong predictor of myocardial
      infarction (MI), stroke and cardiovascular death. Annually, approximately 10% of 
      ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events can be attributed to the
      progression of PAD. Compared with patients without PAD, the 10-year risk of
      all-cause mortality is 3-fold higher in patients with PAD with 4-5 times greater 
      risk of dying from cardiovascular event. The risk of coronary heart disease is 6 
      times greater and increases 15-fold in patients with advanced or severe PAD.
      Among subjects with diabetes, the risk of PAD is often severe and associated with
      extensive arterial calcification. In these patients the risk of PAD increases two
      to four fold. The results of the Canadian public survey of knowledge of PAD
      demonstrated that Canadians are unaware of the morbidity and mortality associated
      with PAD. Despite its prevalence and cardiovascular risk implications, only 25%
      of PAD patients are undergoing treatment. The diagnosis of PAD is difficult as
      most patients remain asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms do not present until
      there is at least 50% narrowing of an artery. In the general population, only 10%
      of persons with PAD have classic symptoms of claudication, 40% do not complain of
      leg pain, while the remaining 50% have a variety of leg symptoms different from
      classic claudication. The severity of symptoms depends on the degree of stenosis.
      The need to intervene is more urgent in patients with limb threatening ischemia
      as manifested by night pain, rest pain, ischemic ulcers or gangrene. Without
      successful revascularization those with critical ischemia have a limb loss
      (amputation) rate of 80-90% in one year. Diagnosis of PAD is generally
      non-invasive and can be performed in the physician offices or on an outpatient
      basis in a hospital. Most common diagnostic procedure include: 1) Ankle Brachial 
      Index (ABI), a ratio of the blood pressure readings between the highest ankle
      pressure and the highest brachial (arm) pressure; and 2) Doppler ultrasonography,
      a diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of ultrasound and wave
      form recordings to evaluate arterial flow in blood vessels. The value of the ABI 
      can provide an assessment of the severity of the disease. Other non invasive
      imaging techniques include: Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance
      Angiography (MRA). Definitive diagnosis of PAD can be made by an invasive
      catheter based angiography procedure which shows the roadmap of the arteries,
      depicting the exact location and length of the stenosis / occlusion. Angiography 
      is the standard method against which all other imaging procedures are compared
      for accuracy. More than 70% of the patients diagnosed with PAD remain stable or
      improve with conservative management of pharmacologic agents and life style
      modifications. Significant PAD symptoms are well known to negatively influence an
      individual quality of life. For those who do not improve, revascularization
      methods either invasive or non-invasive can be used to restore peripheral
      circulation. TECHNOLOGY UNDER REVIEW: A Stent is a wire mesh "scaffold" that is
      permanently implanted in the artery to keep the artery open and can be combined
      with angioplasty to treat PAD. There are two types of stents: i)
      balloon-expandable and ii) self expandable stents and are available in varying
      length. The former uses an angioplasty balloon to expand and set the stent within
      the arterial segment. Recently, drug-eluting stents have been developed and these
      types of stents release small amounts of medication intended to reduce neointimal
      hyperplasia, which can cause re-stenosis at the stent site. Endovascular stenting
      avoids the problem of early elastic recoil, residual stenosis and flow limiting
      dissection after balloon angioplasty. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: In individuals with PAD
      of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and
      iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), is primary stenting more effective than
      percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) in improving patency?In individuals
      with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal,
      crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), does primary stenting provide
      immediate success compared to PTA?In individuals with PAD of the lower
      extremities (superficial femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery
      stenosis or occlusion), is primary stenting associated with less complications
      compared to PTA?In individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial
      femoral artery, infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion), 
      does primary stenting compared to PTA reduce the rate of re-intervention?In
      individuals with PAD of the lower extremities (superficial femoral artery,
      infra-popliteal, crural and iliac artery stenosis or occlusion) is primary
      stenting more effective than PTA in improving clinical and hemodynamic
      success?Are drug eluting stents more effective than bare stents in improving
      patency, reducing rates of re-interventions or complications? RESEARCH METHODS:
      LITERATURE SEARCH: A literature search was performed on February 2, 2010 using
      OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, OVID EMBASE,
      the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology
      Assessment (INAHTA). Abstracts were reviewed by a single reviewer and, for those 
      studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained.
      Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not
      identified through the search. The quality of evidence was assessed as high,
      moderate, low or very low according to GRADE methodology. INCLUSION CRITERIA:
      English language full-reports from 1950 to January Week 3, 2010Comparative
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses of
      RCTsProven diagnosis of PAD of the lower extremities in all patients.Adult
      patients at least 18 years of age.Stent as at least one treatment arm.Patency,
      re-stenosis, re-intervention, technical success, hemodynamic (ABI) and clinical
      improvement and complications as at least an outcome. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:
      Non-randomized studiesObservational studies (cohort or retrospective studies) and
      case reportFeasibility studiesStudies that have evaluated stent but not as a
      primary intervention OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: The primary outcome measure was
      patency. Secondary measures included technical success, re-intervention,
      complications, hemodynamic (ankle brachial pressure index, treadmill walking
      distance) and clinical success or improvement according to Rutherford scale. It
      was anticipated, a priori, that there would be substantial differences among
      trials regarding the method of examination and definitions of patency or
      re-stenosis. Where studies reported only re-stenosis rates, patency rates were
      calculated as 1 minus re-stenosis rates. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Odds ratios (for
      binary outcomes) or mean difference (for continuous outcomes) with 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated for each endpoint. An intention to treat principle
      (ITT) was used, with the total number of patients randomized to each study arm as
      the denominator for each proportion. Sensitivity analysis was performed using per
      protocol approach. A pooled odds ratio (POR) or mean difference for each endpoint
      was then calculated for all trials reporting that endpoint using a fixed effects 
      model. PORs were calculated for comparisons of primary stenting versus PTA or
      other alternative procedures. Level of significance was set at alpha=0.05.
      Homogeneity was assessed using the chi-square test, I(2) and by visual inspection
      of forest plots. If heterogeneity was encountered within groups (P < 0.10), a
      random effects model was used. All statistical analyses were performed using
      RevMan 5. Where sufficient data were available, these analyses were repeated
      within subgroups of patients defined by time of outcome assessment to evaluate
      sustainability of treatment benefit. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - The association between cigarette smoking and risk of colorectal cancer in a
      large prospective cohort from the United States.
PG  - 3362-7
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-09-0661 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported a 20% to 60% increase in risk of
      colorectal cancer associated with active smoking. However, neither the U.S.
      Surgeon General nor the IARC have classified the relationship as causal because
      of concern about residual confounding. METHODS: In a prospective study of 184,187
      people followed from 1992 to 2005, we used Cox proportional hazard models to
      examine the relationship of cigarette smoking to incident colorectal cancer,
      controlling for screening and multiple known and putative risk factors.
      Information on smoking and time-varying covariates was updated in 1997, 1999,
      2001, and 2003. RESULTS: The incidence of colorectal cancer was significantly
      higher in current [hazard ratios (HR), 1.27; 95% confidence intervals (CI),
      1.06-1.52] and former smokers (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36) compared with
      lifelong nonsmokers in analyses that controlled for 13 covariates, including
      screening. The relative risk was greatest among current smokers with at least 50 
      years of smoking (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.04-1.84). Among former smokers, risk of
      colorectal cancer decreased with greater time since cessation (P trend = 0.0003),
      and also decreased with earlier age at cessation (P trend = 0.0014). No
      association was seen among former smokers who had quit before age of 40 years or 
      abstained for 31 years or more. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term cigarette smoking is
      associated with colorectal cancer, even after controlling for screening and
      multiple other risk factors.

TI  - Ethnic differences in drinking outcomes following a brief alcohol intervention in
      the trauma care setting.
PG  - 62-73
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02737.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that brief interventions in the trauma care setting
      reduce drinking, subsequent injury and driving under the influence (DUI) arrest. 
      However, evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions in ethnic minority 
      groups is lacking. The current study evaluates the efficacy of brief intervention
      among whites, blacks and Hispanics in the United States. METHODS: We conducted a 
      two-group parallel randomized trial comparing brief motivational intervention
      (BMI) and treatment as usual with assessment (TAU+) to evaluate treatment
      differences in drinking patterns by ethnicity. Patients were recruited from a
      level 1 urban trauma center over a 2-year period. The study included 1493 trauma 
      patients, including 668 whites, 288 blacks and 537 Hispanics. Hierarchical linear
      modeling was used to evaluate ethnic differences in drinking outcomes including
      volume per week, maximum amount consumed in 1 day, percentage days abstinent and 
      percentage days heavy drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up. Analyses controlled 
      for age, gender, employment status, marital status, prior alcohol treatment, type
      of injury and injury severity. Special emphasis was given to potential ethnic
      differences by testing the interaction between ethnicity and BMI. RESULTS: At 6- 
      and 12-month follow-up, BMI significantly reduced maximum amount consumed in 1
      day (P < 0.001; P < 0.001, respectively) and percentage days heavy drinking (P < 
      0.05; P < 0.05, respectively) among Hispanics. Hispanics in the BMI group also
      reduced average volume per week at 12-month follow-up (chi(2) = 6.8, df = 1, P < 
      0.01). In addition, Hispanics in TAU+ reduced maximum amount consumed at 6- and
      12-month follow-up (P < 0.001; P < 0.001) and volume per week at 12-month
      follow-up (P < 0.001). Whites and blacks in both BMI and TAU+ reduced volume per 
      week and percentage days heavy drinking at 12-month follow-up (P < 0.001; P <
      0.01, respectively) and decreased maximum amount at 6- (P < 0.001) and 12-month
      follow-up (P < 0.001). All three ethnic groups In both BMI and TAU+ reduced
      volume per week at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.001) and percentage days abstinent at
      6- (P < 0.001) and 12-month follow-up (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: All three ethnic 
      groups evidenced reductions in drinking at 6- and 12-month follow-up independent 
      of treatment assignment. Among Hispanics, BMI reduced alcohol intake
      significantly as measured by average volume per week, percentage days heavy
      drinking and maximum amount consumed in 1 day.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review nicotine addiction, to examine how tobacco use has a direct
      negative impact on common disorders seen in allergy practice, and to provide a
      summary of the national guidelines for treating tobacco use and dependence. DATA 
      SOURCES: OVID searches were performed cross-referencing the keywords tobacco
      cessation, tobacco use, environmental tobacco exposure, and smoking with multiple
      disorders commonly seen in allergy practice. References of the chosen articles
      were also examined. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected based on their
      relevance to the subject matter and currency. RESULTS: The current US smoking
      rate far exceeds the desired national goal established by Healthy People 2010.
      Efforts have been made by the US Public Health Department to streamline the
      treatment of smoking use and dependence for all physicians. Published research
      strongly supports the negative impact smoking has on asthma, chronic rhinitis,
      allergic sensitization, and immunodeficiency disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Allergists
      know the significant impact that smoking has and will make on the lives and
      health of patients. It is important for these specialists to make an impact on
      the chronic disease of tobacco addiction because it directly affects the care
      rendered. By using the standardized tobacco use treatment concept of the 5 A's
      (ask, advise, assess, assist, and arrange), allergists can make a positive impact
      on reducing US smoking rates and improve patient health. Screening, providing
      brief counseling, and prescribing first-line smoking cessation medications will
      help the United States get closer to achieving the national goal laid out in
      Healthy People 2010 of smoking rates of 12% or less.

TI  - A multisite randomized effectiveness trial of motivational enhancement therapy
      for Spanish-speaking substance users.
PG  - 993-9
LID - 10.1037/a0016489 [doi]
AB  - Hispanic individuals are underrepresented in clinical and research populations
      and are often excluded from clinical trials in the United States. Hence, there
      are few data on the effectiveness of most empirically validated therapies for
      Hispanic substance users. The authors conducted a multisite randomized trial
      comparing the effectiveness of 3 individual sessions of motivational enhancement 
      therapy with that of 3 individual sessions of counseling as usual on treatment
      retention and frequency of substance use; all assessment and treatment sessions
      were conducted in Spanish among 405 individuals seeking treatment for any type of
      current substance use. Treatment exposure was good, with 66% of participants
      completing all 3 protocol sessions. Although both interventions resulted in
      reductions in substance use during the 4-week therapy phase, there were no
      significant Treatment Condition x Time interactions nor Site x Treatment
      Condition interactions. Results suggest that the individual treatments delivered 
      in Spanish were both attractive to and effective with this heterogeneous group of
      Hispanic adults, but the differential effectiveness of motivational enhancement
      therapy may be limited to those whose primary substance use problem is alcohol
      and may be fairly modest in magnitude.

TI  - Do Canadian prenatal record forms integrate evidence-based guidelines for the
      diagnosis of a FASD?
PG  - 274-80
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a significant public health issue with
      lifelong psychological, emotional and financial costs associated with caring for 
      an affected individual. In 2005, the Public Health Agency of Canada and Health
      Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch developed evidence-based
      guidelines for the diagnosis of a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). We
      examined the extent to which prenatal records across Canadian provinces and
      territories currently integrate key recommendations from these guidelines.
      METHODS: A content analysis of prenatal record forms retrieved from each Canadian
      province and territory (N = 12) was conducted to identify all questions or
      intervention prompts related to prenatal screening, exposure assessment,
      counseling or referral for maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Findings were
      reviewed in relation to recommendations extrapolated from the Canadian guidelines
      and the FASD literature. RESULTS: All the prenatal record forms contained
      questions to assess maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the
      dimensions of alcohol consumption assessed and the format, wording and number of 
      items related to each dimension varied markedly across provinces/territories.
      Only five prenatal record forms included a validated screening tool to identify
      risky alcohol drinking behaviour. Most of the forms lacked prompts to encourage
      providers to intervene or refer pregnant clients with high-risk drinking
      behaviour. CONCLUSION: Integration of the Canadian recommendations into Canadian 
      prenatal record forms may be an effective public health strategy for helping
      identify pregnancies at high risk for alcohol exposure, reducing the incidence of
      a FASD through appropriate prenatal intervention and referral, and facilitating
      early diagnosis of a FASD.

TI  - Motivation and patch treatment for HIV+ smokers: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1891-900
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02623.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To test the efficacy of two smoking cessation interventions in a HIV
      positive (HIV+) sample: standard care (SC) treatment plus nicotine replacement
      therapy (NRT) versus more intensive motivationally enhanced (ME) treatment plus
      NRT. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: HIV+ smoker referrals from
      eight immunology clinics in the northeastern United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total
      of 444 participants enrolled in the study (mean age = 42.07 years; 63.28% male;
      51.80% European American; mean cigarettes/day = 18.27). INTERVENTIONS: SC
      participants received two brief sessions with a health educator. Those setting a 
      quit date received self-help quitting materials and NRT. ME participants received
      four sessions of motivational counseling and a quit-day counseling call. All ME
      intervention materials were tailored to the needs of HIV+ individuals.
      MEASUREMENTS: Biochemically verified 7-day abstinence rates at 2-month, 4-month
      and 6-month follow-ups. FINDINGS: Intent-to-treat (ITT) abstinence rates at
      2-month, 4-month and 6-month follow-ups were 12%, 9% and 9%, respectively, in the
      ME condition, and 13%, 10% and 10%, respectively, in the SC condition, indicating
      no between-group differences. Among 412 participants with treatment utilization
      data, 6-month ITT abstinence rates were associated positively with low nicotine
      dependence (P = 0.02), high motivation to quit (P = 0.04) and Hispanic American
      race/ethnicity (P = 0.02). Adjusting for these variables, each additional NRT
      contact improved the odds of smoking abstinence by a third (odds ratio = 1.32,
      95% confidence interval = 0.99-1.75). CONCLUSIONS: Motivationally enhanced
      treatment plus NRT did not improve cessation rates over and above standard care
      treatment plus NRT in this HIV+ sample of smokers. Providers offering brief
      support and encouraging use of nicotine replacement may be able to help HIV+
      patients to quit smoking.

TI  - Best practices for smoking cessation interventions in primary care.
PG  - 129-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Canada, smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature
      death. Family physicians and nurse practitioners are uniquely positioned to
      initiate smoking cessation. Because smoking is a chronic addiction, repeated,
      opportunity-based interventions are most effective in addressing physical
      dependence and modifying deeply ingrained patterns of beliefs and behaviour.
      However, only a small minority of family physicians provide thorough smoking
      cessation counselling and less than one-half offer adjunct support to patients.
      OBJECTIVE: To identify the key steps family physicians and nurse practitioners
      can take to strengthen effective smoking cessation interventions for their
      patients. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of health care practitioners
      involved with smoking cessation from across Canada was convened to discuss best
      practices derived from international guidelines, including those from the United 
      States, Europe, and Australia, and other relevant literature. The panellists
      subsequently refined their findings in the form of the present article. RESULTS: 
      The present paper outlines best practices for brief and effective counselling
      for, and treatment of, tobacco addiction. By adopting a simple series of
      questions, taking 30 s to 3 min to complete, health care professionals can
      initiate smoking cessation interventions. Integrating these strategies into daily
      practice provides opportunities to significantly improve the quality and duration
      of patients' lives. CONCLUSION: Tobacco addiction is the most important
      preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in Canada. Family physicians, nurse 
      practitioners and other front-line health care professionals are well positioned 
      to influence and assist their patients in quitting, thereby reducing the burden
      on both personal health and the public health care system.

TI  - The adoption of smoke-free hospital campuses in the United States.
PG  - 451-8
LID - 10.1136/tc.2009.030494 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The adoption of a smoke-free hospital campus policy is often a highly
      publicised local event. National media coverage suggests that the trend towards
      adopting these policies is growing, and this publicity can frequently lead
      hospital administrators to consider the adoption of such policies within their
      own institutions. Little is actually known, however, about the prevalence of
      these policies or their impact. OBJECTIVES: To determine the national prevalence 
      of smoke-free hospital campus policies and the relation between these policies
      and performance on nationally standardised measures for smoking cessation
      counselling in US hospitals. METHODS: 4494 Joint Commission-accredited hospitals 
      were invited to complete a web-based questionnaire assessing current smoking
      policies and future plans. Smoking cessation counselling rates were assessed
      through nationally standardised measures. RESULTS: The 1916 hospitals responding 
      to the survey (43%) were statistically similar to non-responders with respect to 
      performance measure rates, smoking policies and demographic characteristics.
      Approximately 45% of responders reported an existing smoke-free hospital campus
      policy. With respect to demographics, higher proportions of smoke-free campus
      policies were reported in non-teaching and non-profit hospitals. Smoke-free
      campus hospitals were also more likely to provide smoking cessation counselling
      to patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure and pneumonia who
      smoke (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: By February 2008, 45% of US hospitals (up from
      approximately 3% in 1992) had adopted a smoke-free campus policy; another 15%
      reported actively pursuing the adoption of such a policy. By the end of 2009, it 
      is likely that the majority of US hospitals will have a smoke-free campus.

      outpatients.
PG  - 33-41
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2009.05.025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high smoking prevalence has been registered among alcoholics. It
      has been pointed out that alcoholic smokers may have a more severe course and
      greater severity of alcoholism. This study aims at comparing smoking and
      non-smoking alcoholics in terms of treatment outcomes and verifying the efficacy 
      of topiramate and naltrexone to decrease the use of cigarettes among alcoholic
      smokers. METHODS: The investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      12-week study carried out at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The sample
      comprised 155 male alcohol-dependent outpatients (52 non-smokers and 103
      smokers), 18-60 years of age, with an International Classification of Diseases
      (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence. After a 1-week detoxification period,
      the patients randomly received placebo, naltrexone (50mg/day) or topiramate (up
      to 300 mg/day). Only the alcoholic smokers who adhered to the treatment were
      evaluated with reference to the smoking reduction. RESULTS: Cox regression
      analysis revealed that the smoking status among alcoholics increased the odds of 
      relapse into drinking by 65%, independently of the medications prescribed, using 
      the intention-to-treat method. Topiramate showed effectiveness to reduce the
      number of cigarettes smoked when compared to placebo among adherent patients
      (mean difference=7.91, p<0.01). There were no significant differences between the
      naltrexone group and the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study
      confirm that the treatment is more challenging for smoking alcoholics than for
      non-smoking ones and support the efficacy of topiramate in the smoking reduction 
      among male alcoholic smokers who adhered to the treatment.

PG  - 625-32
LID - 10.1001/archpediatrics.2009.88 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Project ALERT on adolescents' lifetime and 
      30-day use of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants. DESIGN: Cluster
      randomized trial. SETTING: Schools from 11 states were enrolled in 2 successive
      cohorts from 2004 to 2008. PARTICIPANTS: All public schools in the United States 
      that included grades 6 through 8 and enrolled at least 100 students in sixth
      grade were recruited. Of the 40 schools that began the study, 34 (17 per
      condition) completed it. Data were analyzed from 5883 unique participants.
      Intervention Project ALERT, a manualized classroom-based substance use prevention
      curriculum for the middle grades, was taught to sixth and seventh graders. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Students were surveyed before the onset of the intervention, as
      sixth graders, and after the completion of the 2-year intervention, as seventh
      graders. Outcome measures included lifetime and 30-day use of cigarettes,
      alcohol, marijuana, and inhalants. RESULTS: At baseline, students in the
      intervention condition were slightly to moderately more likely to report use for 
      each of the 8 measures examined than were students in the control condition. For 
      all measures except lifetime use of cigarettes, these differences were less
      pronounced at follow-up and therefore were in the direction of favorable program 
      effects. These changes were statistically significant, however, for only 1
      outcome measure, past 30-day use of alcohol (reduction in the adjusted odds ratio
      from 2.07 at baseline to 1.32 at follow-up; P = .006). CONCLUSION: Project ALERT 
      was not effective when delivered to the sixth grade population we targeted.

TI  - Trial of the university assistance program for alcohol use among mandated
      students.
PG  - 45-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a brief 
      intervention for mandated students in the context of the University Assistance
      Program, a Student Assistance Program developed and modeled after workplace
      Employee Assistance Programs. METHOD: Participants were 265 (196 males and 69
      females) judicially mandated college students enrolled in a large, urban
      university in the northeast United States. All participants were sanctioned by
      the university's judicial office for an alcohol- or drug-related violation.
      Participants were randomized to one of two intervention conditions (the
      University Assistance Program or services as usual) and were assessed at baseline
      and 3 and 6 months after intervention. RESULTS: Growth curve analyses showed
      that, relative to services as usual, the University Assistance Program was more
      efficacious in reducing past-90-day weekday alcohol consumption and the number of
      alcohol-related consequences while increasing past-90-day use of protective
      behaviors and coping skills. No significant differences in growth trajectories
      were found between the two intervention conditions on past-90-day blood alcohol
      concentration, total alcohol consumption, or weekend consumption. CONCLUSIONS:
      The University Assistance Program may have a possible advantage over services as 
      usual for mandated students.

TI  - Smoking cessation initiated during hospital stay for patients with coronary
      artery disease: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1297-303
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.080862 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Programs for smoking cessation for cardiac patients are underused in 
      Canada. We examined the efficacy of an intervention for smoking cessation for
      patients admitted to hospital for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or because 
      of acute myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS: Nurses randomly assigned 276
      sequential patients admitted because of acute MI or for CABG who met the
      inclusion criteria. Participants received an intensive or minimal
      smoking-cessation intervention. The minimal intervention included advice from
      physicians and nurses and 2 pamphlets. The intensive intervention included the
      minimal intervention plus 60 minutes of bedside counselling, take-home materials 
      and 7 nurse-initiated counselling calls for 2 months after discharge. The
      outcomes were point prevalence of abstinence at 3, 6 and 12 months after
      discharge. RESULTS: The 12-month self-reported rate of abstinence was 62% among
      patients in the intensive group and 46% among those in the minimal group (odds
      ratio [OR] 2.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-3.1). Abstinence was confirmed
      for 54% of patients in the intensive group and 35% in the minimal group (OR 2.0, 
      95% CI 1.3-3.6). Abstinence was significantly lower among those who used
      pharmacotherapy than among those who did not (p < 0.001). Continuous 12-month
      abstinence was 57% in the intensive group and 39% in the minimal group (p <
      0.01). It was significantly higher among patients admitted for CABG than among
      those admitted because of acute MI (p < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: Providing
      intensive programs for smoking cessation for patients admitted for CABG or
      because of acute MI could have a major impact on health and health care costs.

TI  - Management and treatment of patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension:
      recommendations from the Department of Veterans Affairs Hepatitis C Resource
      Center Program and the National Hepatitis C Program.
PG  - 1802-29
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2009.191 [doi]
AB  - Cirrhosis represents the end stage of any chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C and 
      alcohol are currently the main causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Although
      initially cirrhosis is compensated, it eventually becomes decompensated, as
      defined by the presence of ascites, variceal hemorrhage, encephalopathy, and/or
      jaundice. These management recommendations are divided according to the status,
      compensated or decompensated, of the cirrhotic patient, with a separate section
      for the screening, diagnosis, and management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
      as this applies to patients with both compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. In
      the compensated patient, the main objective is to prevent variceal hemorrhage and
      any practice that could lead to decompensation. In the decompensated patient,
      acute variceal hemorrhage and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are severe
      complications that require hospitalization. Hepatorenal syndrome is also a severe
      complication of cirrhosis but one that usually occurs in patients who are already
      in the hospital and, as it represents an extreme of the hemodynamic alterations
      that lead to ascites formation, it is placed under treatment of ascites. Recent
      advances in the pathophysiology of the complications of cirrhosis have allowed
      for a more rational management of cirrhosis and also for the stratification of
      patients into different risk groups that require different management. These
      recommendations are based on evidence in the literature, mainly from randomized
      clinical trials and meta-analyses of these trials. When few or no data exist from
      well-designed prospective trials, emphasis is given to results from large series 
      and consensus conferences with involvement of recognized experts. A rational
      management of cirrhosis will result in improvements in quality of life, treatment
      adherence, and, ultimately, in outcomes.

TI  - Smokeless tobacco cessation in military personnel: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 730-8
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntp057 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Military personnel are twice as likely as civilians to use
      smokeless tobacco (ST). This study evaluated the efficacy of a minimal-contact ST
      cessation program in military personnel. METHODS: Participants were recruited
      from 24 military dental clinics across the United States during annual dental
      examinations. Participants were 785 active-duty military personnel who were
      randomly assigned to receive a minimal-contact behavioral treatment (n = 392) or 
      usual care (n = 393). The behavioral treatment included an ST cessation manual, a
      videotape cessation guide tailored for military personnel, and three 15-min
      telephone counseling sessions using motivational interviewing methods. Usual care
      consisted of standard procedures that are part of the annual dental examination, 
      including recommendations to quit using ST and referral to extant local tobacco
      cessation programs. Participants were assessed at 3 and 6 months after
      enrollment. RESULTS: Participants in the ST cessation program were significantly 
      more likely to be abstinent from all tobacco, as assessed by repeated point
      prevalence at both 3 and 6 months (25.0%), and were significantly more likely to 
      be abstinent from ST use for 6 months, as assessed by prolonged abstinence
      (16.8%), compared with participants in usual care (7.6% and 6.4%, respectively). 
      DISCUSSION: These results indicate that a minimal-contact behavioral treatment
      can significantly reduce ST use in military personnel and has the potential for
      widespread dissemination. If ST users were identified in dental visits and
      routinely referred to telephone counseling, this could have a substantial benefit
      for the health and well-being of military personnel.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of oral cancer screening: results from a cluster randomized
      controlled trial in India.
PG  - 200-6
LID - S0042-96862009000300014 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate oral cancer screening by visual inspection. METHODS: A
      cluster randomized controlled trial was initiated in Trivandrum district, Kerala,
      India. Of 13 population clusters, seven were randomly allocated to three rounds
      of screening between 1996 and 2004, while standard care was provided in six
      (control arm). An activity-based approach was employed to calculate costs
      associated with various components of the screening trial. Information on the
      resources used and on clinical events in each trial arm was derived from trial
      databases. Total costs for each cluster were estimated in 2004 United States
      dollars (US$). The incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated for all
      eligible individuals and for high-risk individuals (i.e. tobacco or alcohol
      users). FINDINGS: The proportion of oral cancers detected at an early stage (i.e.
      stage I or II) was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm (42%
      versus 24%, respectively). The incremental cost per life-year saved was US$ 835
      for all individuals eligible for screening and US$ 156 for high-risk individuals.
      Oral cancer screening by visual inspection was performed for under US$ 6 per
      person. CONCLUSION: The most cost-effective approach to oral cancer screening by 
      visual inspection is to offer it to the high-risk population. Targeted screening 
      of this group will ensure that screening can be offered at a reasonable cost in a
      limited-resource setting.

TI  - Screening and recording of alcohol use among women of child-bearing age and
      pregnant women.
PG  - e242-63
AB  - A woman's alcohol use during pregnancy is one of the top preventable causes of
      birth defects and developmental disabilities that are known as fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASD). The social and economic burden of FASD is substantial.
      Lifetime direct tangible costs per individual related to health care, education
      and social services in Canada have been estimated to be $1.4 million. Screening
      women of child-bearing age and pregnant women and recording their alcohol
      consumption is a practical process to identify and evaluate women at-risk and to 
      identify potentially exposed infants. The FASD Advisory Workgroup proposes the
      following three levels of screenings which should be done on consenting women:
      Level I screening involves practice-based approaches that can be used by health
      care providers when talking to women about alcohol use, such as motivational
      interviewing and supportive dialogue. Level II screening includes a number of
      structured questionnaires that can be used with direct questioning (TLFB) or
      indirect /masked screening (AUDIT, BMAST / SMAST, CAGE, CRAFFT, T-ACE, TWEAK).
      Level III screening includes laboratory-based tools that can be used to confirm
      the presence of a drug, its level of exposure and determine the presence of
      multiple drugs. There are challenges and limitations in the use of the screening 
      and assessment tools outlined. For example, the single question about alcohol use
      and the various questionnaires rely on a woman to provide details about her
      alcohol use. There is no consensus on the appropriate screening to use across
      Canada as each provincial / territorial jurisdiction, health care organization
      and healthcare provider uses a variety of formal and informal screening tool. In 
      addition, there are inconsistent processes across Canada for the recording of the
      alcohol use in a woman's chart and the transfer of the information to the infant 
      and the child's health records. The FASD Advisory Workgroup proposes eleven
      recommendations to improve the screening and recording processes for alcohol use 
      in women of child-bearing age and pregnant women.

TI  - A randomized clinical trial of methadone maintenance for prisoners: results at 12
      months postrelease.

AB  - This study examined the impact of prison-initiated methadone maintenance at 12
      months postrelease. Males with pre-incarceration heroin dependence (N = 204) were
      randomly assigned to (a) Counseling Only: counseling in prison, with passive
      referral to treatment upon release; (b) Counseling + Transfer: counseling in
      prison with transfer to methadone maintenance treatment upon release; and (c)
      Counseling + Methadone: counseling and methadone maintenance in prison, continued
      in the community upon release. The mean number of days in community-based drug
      abuse treatment were, respectively, Counseling Only, 23.1; Counseling + Transfer,
      91.3; and Counseling + Methadone, 166.0 (p < .01); all pairwise comparisons were 
      statistically significant (all ps < .01). Counseling + Methadone participants
      were also significantly less likely than participants in each of the other two
      groups to be opioid-positive or cocaine-positive according to urine drug testing.
      These results support the effectiveness of prison-initiated methadone for males
      in the United States. Further study is required to confirm the findings for
      women.

TI  - Interventions for children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs):
      overview of findings for five innovative research projects.
PG  - 986-1006
LID - 10.1016/j.ridd.2009.02.003 [doi]
AB  - It is well established that prenatal exposure to alcohol causes damage to the
      developing fetus, resulting in a spectrum of disorders known as fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders (FASDs). Although our understanding of the deficits and
      disturbances associated with FASDs is far from complete, there are consistent
      findings indicating these are serious, lifelong disabilities-especially when
      these disabilities result from central nervous system damage. Until recently,
      information and strategies for interventions specific to individuals with FASDs
      have been gleaned from interventions used with people with other disabilities and
      from the practical wisdom gained by parents and clinicians through trial and
      error or shared through informal networks. Although informative to a limited
      degree, such interventions have been implemented without being evaluated
      systematically or scientifically. The purpose of this article is to provide a
      brief overview of a general intervention framework developed for individuals with
      FASDs and the methods and general findings of five specific intervention research
      studies conducted within this framework. The studies evaluated five different
      interventions in five diverse locations in the United States, with different
      segments of the FASD population. Nonetheless, all participants showed improvement
      in the target behaviors or skills, with four studies achieving statistical
      significance in treatment outcomes. Important lessons emerged from these five
      interventions that may explain success: including parent education or training,
      teaching children specific skills they would usually learn by observation or
      abstraction, and integration into existing systems of treatment. A major
      implication of these research studies for families dealing with FASDs is that
      there are now interventions available that can address their children's needs and
      that can be presented as scientifically validated and efficacious to intervention
      agents such as schools, social services, and mental health providers. In the
      field of FASD research and clinical service, a common theme reported by families 
      has been that clinicians and professionals have been reluctant to diagnose their 
      children because there were no known effective treatments. Results of these five 
      studies dispel that concern by demonstrating several interventions that have been
      shown to improve the lives of individuals with FASDs and their families.

TI  - Increased risk of oncogenic human papillomavirus infections and incident
      high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among smokers: experience from the 
      Latin American screening study.
PG  - 241-8
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181935a7d [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of smoking on the 
      prevalence and incidence of high-risk human papillomavirus (hr-HPV) infection and
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in a large sample of Latin American
      women. METHODS: The study examines baseline data on over 12,000 women included in
      the Latin American Screening Study (Brazil and Argentina), and over 1000 women
      followed-up for a period of 36 months. Three groups were formed: never smokers,
      current, and past smokers. The prevalence of hr-HPV infection and CIN were
      compared between the study groups. In the prospective analysis, women were
      controlled at 6-month intervals to assess the cumulative risk of incident hr-HPV 
      infection, smear abnormalities, and CIN. RESULTS: A higher prevalence (21.7%) of 
      hr-HPV infection was found among current smokers as compared to never smokers
      (16.5%) or past smokers (13.5%). Being current smoker was significantly (P <0.01)
      associated with hr-HPV detection (OR = 1.6; 95% CI = 1.2-2.1). Being a current
      smoker was a significant predictor of incident hr-HPV during the follow-up
      [Hazards ratio (HR) = 1.4; 95% CI 1.0-1.9]. For incident CIN2+, being a past
      smoker (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.6-9.8) or current smoker (HR = 3.6; 95% CI 1.5-8.6)
      were the significant independent predictors. Current and past smokers had a
      significantly increased risk of incident CIN2+ (P <0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Smoking
      increases the risk of contracting hr-HPV infection and modifies the effect of a
      persistent hr-HPV infection by further increasing the risk of developing CIN2+.
      It seems that this effect modification persists over several years after smoking 
      cessation.

TI  - "Real-world" effectiveness of reactive telephone counseling for smoking
      cessation: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1229-36
LID - 10.1378/chest.08-2425 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Reactive telephone helplines for smoking cessation (where all calls
      to counselors are smoker initiated) are increasingly used in the United States.
      However, limited data from randomized controlled trials are available on their
      effectiveness. The study objective was to evaluate the real-world effectiveness
      of reactive telephone counseling for smoking cessation using a randomized
      controlled trial study design. METHODS: The study was implemented during a period
      from 2003 to 2006 to evaluate a reactive telephone helpline run by the American
      Lung Association chapter of Illinois-Iowa. The 990 new callers, all adult current
      smokers who called the helpline, were randomized on their first call into one of 
      the two following groups: a control group that received only mailed self-help
      literature (n = 496); and a study group that received supplemental live reactive 
      telephone counseling (n = 494). Telephone follow-up was completed at 1, 3, 6, and
      12 months after study enrollment by interviewers blinded to group assignment.
      Seven-day point prevalence rates of self-reported abstinence at follow-up
      evaluations were compared between the two groups using an intent-to-treat design.
      RESULTS: The two groups did not differ significantly in baseline demographics and
      smoking-related behavior. The abstinence rates (ranging between 0.09 and 0.15)
      were not significantly different between the two groups at 1-, 3-, 6-, and
      12-month follow-up evaluations. Post hoc subgroup analysis showed that black
      callers had lower abstinence rates at the 3- and 12-month follow-up evaluations
      as compared with white callers. CONCLUSION: Supplemental live, reactive telephone
      counseling does not provide greater success in smoking cessation than self-help
      educational materials alone.

TI  - Evaluation of an evidence-based tobacco treatment curriculum for psychiatry
      residency training programs.
PG  - 484-92
LID - 10.1176/appi.ap.32.6.484 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Smokers with mental illness and addictive disorders account for nearly
      one in two cigarettes sold in the United States and are at high risk for
      smoking-related deaths and disability. Psychiatry residency programs provide a
      unique arena for disseminating tobacco treatment guidelines, influencing
      professional norms, and increasing access to tobacco cessation services among
      smokers with mental illness. The current study evaluated the Rx for Change in
      Psychiatry curriculum, developed for psychiatry residency programs and focused on
      identifying and treating tobacco dependence among individuals with mental
      illness. METHODS: The 4-hour curriculum emphasized evidence-based,
      patient-oriented cessation treatments relevant for all tobacco users, including
      those not yet ready to quit. The curriculum was informed by comprehensive
      literature review, consultation with an expert advisory group, faculty
      interviews, and a focus group with psychiatry residents. This study reports on
      evaluation of the curriculum in 2005-2006, using a quasi-experimental design,
      with 55 residents in three psychiatry residency training programs in Northern
      California. RESULTS: The curriculum was associated with improvements in
      psychiatry residents' knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and counseling behaviors 
      for treating tobacco use among their patients, with initial changes from pre- to 
      posttraining sustained at 3-months' follow-up. Residents' self-reported changes
      in treating patients' tobacco use were substantiated through systematic chart
      review. CONCLUSION: The evidence-based Rx for Change in Psychiatry curriculum is 
      offered as a model tobacco treatment curriculum that can be implemented in
      psychiatry residency training programs and disseminated widely, thereby
      effectively reaching a vulnerable and costly population of smokers.

TI  - Behavioural interventions for type 2 diabetes: an evidence-based analysis.
PG  - 1-45
AB  - In June 2008, the Medical Advisory Secretariat began work on the Diabetes
      Strategy Evidence Project, an evidence-based review of the literature surrounding
      strategies for successful management and treatment of diabetes. This project came
      about when the Health System Strategy Division at the Ministry of Health and
      Long-Term Care subsequently asked the secretariat to provide an evidentiary
      platform for the Ministry's newly released Diabetes Strategy.After an initial
      review of the strategy and consultation with experts, the secretariat identified 
      five key areas in which evidence was needed. Evidence-based analyses have been
      prepared for each of these five areas: insulin pumps, behavioural interventions, 
      bariatric surgery, home telemonitoring, and community based care. For each area, 
      an economic analysis was completed where appropriate and is described in a
      separate report.To review these titles within the Diabetes Strategy Evidence

      is to determine whether behavioural interventions are effective in improving
      glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a
      serious chronic condition affecting millions of people worldwide and is the sixth
      leading cause of death in Canada. In 2005, an estimated 8.8% of Ontario's
      population had diabetes, representing more than 816,000 Ontarians. The direct
      health care cost of diabetes was $1.76 billion in the year 2000 and is projected 
      to rise to a total cost of $3.14 billion by 2016. Much of this cost arises from
      the serious long-term complications associated with the disease including:
      coronary heart disease, stroke, adult blindness, limb amputations and kidney
      disease. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90-95% of diabetes and while type 2
      diabetes is more prevalent in people aged 40 years and older, prevalence in
      younger populations is increasing due to a rise in obesity and physical
      inactivity in children. Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study
      (UKPDS) has shown that tight glycemic control can significantly reduce the risk
      of developing serious complications in type 2 diabetics. Despite physicians' and 
      patients' knowledge of the importance of glycemic control, Canadian data has
      shown that only 38% of patients with diabetes have HbA1C levels in the optimal
      range of 7% or less. This statistic highlights the complexities involved in the
      management of diabetes, which is characterized by extensive patient involvement
      in addition to the support provided by physicians. An enormous demand is,
      therefore, placed on patients to self-manage the physical, emotional and
      psychological aspects of living with a chronic illness. Despite differences in
      individual needs to cope with diabetes, there is general agreement for the
      necessity of supportive programs for patient self-management. While traditional
      programs were didactic models with the goal of improving patients' knowledge of
      their disease, current models focus on behavioural approaches aimed at providing 
      patients with the skills and strategies required to promote and change their
      behaviour. Several meta-analyses and systematic reviews have demonstrated
      improved health outcomes with self-management support programs in type 2
      diabetics. They have all, however, either looked at a specific component of
      self-management support programs (i.e. self-management education) or have been
      conducted in specific populations. Most reviews are also qualitative and do not
      clearly define the interventions of interest, making findings difficult to
      interpret. Moreover, heterogeneity in the interventions has led to conflicting
      evidence on the components of effective programs. There is thus much uncertainty 
      regarding the optimal design and delivery of these programs by policymakers.
      EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Are behavioural
      interventions effective in improving glycemic control in adults with type 2
      diabetes?Is the effectiveness of the intervention impacted by intervention
      characteristics (e.g. delivery of intervention, length of intervention, mode of
      instruction, interventionist etc.)? INCLUSION CRITERIA: English Language
      Published between January 1996 to August 2008 Type 2 diabetic adult population
      (>18 years)Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)Systematic reviews, or
      meta-analyses Describing a multi-faceted self-management support intervention as 
      defined by the 2007 Self-Management Mapping Guide (1)Reporting outcomes of
      glycemic control (HbA1c) with extractable data Studies with a minimum of 6-month 
      follow up EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies with a control group other than usual care 
      Studies with a sample size <30 Studies without a clearly defined intervention
      OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: PRIMARY OUTCOME: glycemic control (HbA1c) SECONDARY
      OUTCOMES: systolic blood pressure (SBP) control, lipid control, change in smoking
      status, weight change, quality of life, knowledge, self-efficacy, managing
      psychosocial aspects of diabetes, assessing dissatisfaction and readiness to
      change, and setting and achieving diabetes goals. SEARCH STRATEGY: A search was
      performed in OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations,
      EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), The 
      Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment
      (INAHTA) for studies published between January 1996 and August 2008. Abstracts
      were reviewed by a single author and studies meeting the inclusion criteria
      outlined above were obtained. Data on population characteristics, glycemic
      control outcomes, and study design were extracted. Reference lists were also
      checked for relevant studies. The quality of the evidence was assessed as being
      either high, moderate, low, or very low according to the GRADE methodology.
      SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: The search identified 638 citations published between 1996
      and August 2008, of which 12 met the inclusion criteria and one was a
      meta-analysis (Gary et al. 2003). The remaining 11 studies were RCTs (9 were used
      in the meta-analysis) and only one was defined as small (total sample size N=47).
      SUMMARY OF PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS ACROSS STUDIES: A total of 2,549 participants
      were included in the 11 identified studies. The mean age of participants reported
      was approximately 58 years and the mean duration of diabetes was approximately 6 
      years. Most studies reported gender with a mean percentage of females of
      approximately 67%. Of the eleven studies, two focused only on women and four
      included only Hispanic individuals. All studies evaluated type 2 diabetes
      patients exclusively. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS: The studies were conducted between
      2002 and 2008. Approximately six of 11 studies were carried out within the USA,
      with the remaining studies conducted in the UK, Sweden, and Israel (sample size
      ranged from 47 to 824 participants). The quality of the studies ranged from
      moderate to low with four of the studies being of moderate quality and the
      remaining seven of low quality (based on the Consort Checklist). Differences in
      quality were mainly due to methodological issues such as inadequate description
      of randomization, sample size calculation allocation concealment, blinding and
      uncertainty of the use of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Patients were
      recruited from several settings: six studies from primary or general medical
      practices, three studies from the community (e.g. via advertisements), and two
      from outpatient diabetes clinics. A usual care control group was reported in nine
      of 11 of the studies and two studies reported some type of minimal diabetes care 
      in addition to usual care for the control group. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS:
      All of the interventions examined in the studies were mapped to the 2007
      Self-management Mapping Guide. The interventions most often focused on problem
      solving, goal setting and encouraging participants to engage in activities that
      protect and promote health (e.g. modifying behaviour, change in diet, and
      increase physical activity). All of the studies examined comprehensive
      interventions targeted at least two self-care topics (e.g. diet, physical
      activity, blood glucose monitoring, foot care, etc.). Despite the homogeneity in 
      the aims of the interventions, there was substantial clinical heterogeneity in
      other intervention characteristics such as duration, intensity, setting, mode of 
      delivery (group vs. individual), interventionist, and outcomes of interest
      (discussed below). DURATION, INTENSITY AND MODE OF DELIVERY: Intervention
      durations ranged from 2 days to 1 year, with many falling into the range of 6 to 
      10 weeks. The rest of the interventions fell into categories of </= 2 weeks (2
      studies), 6 months (2 studies), or 1 year (3 studies). Intensity of the
      interventions varied widely from 6 hours over 2 days, to 52 hours over 1 year;
      however, the majority consisted of interventions of 6 to 15 hours. Both
      individual and group sessions were used to deliver interventions. Group
      counselling was used in five studies as a mode of instruction, three studies used
      both individual and group sessions, and one study used individual sessions as its
      sole mode of instruction. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer screening: an evidence-based
      analysis.
PG  - 1-40
AB  - The colorectal cancer (CRC) screening project was undertaken by the Medical
      Advisory Secretariat (MAS) in collaboration with the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO).In
      November 2007, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC) MAS to
      conduct an evidence-based analysis of the available data with respect to
      colorectal cancer diagnosis and prevention. The general purpose of the project
      was to investigate the effectiveness, cost effectiveness, and safety of the
      various methods and techniques used for colorectal cancer screening in average
      risk people, 50 years of age and older.The options currently offered for
      colorectal cancer screening were reviewed and five technologies were selected for
      review:Computed tomographic (CT) colonographyMagnetic resonance (MR)
      colonographyWireless capsule endoscopy (PillCam Colon)Fecal occult blood test
      (FOBT)Flexible sigmoidoscopyIn this review, colonoscopy was considered as the
      "gold standard" technique by which the effectiveness of all other modalities
      could be evaluated. An economic analysis was also conducted to determine
      cost-effectiveness of different screening modalities.Evidence-based analyses have
      been prepared for each of these technologies, as well as summary document that
      includes an economic analysis, all of which are presented at the MAS Web site:
      http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/providers/program/mas/tech/techmn.html
      OBJECTIVE: The objective of this evidence review is to examine the effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness of fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), including guaiac
      FOBT (gFOBT) and immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT), for use in colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      screening in asymptomatic, average-risk adults. Specifically: Is the use of gFOBT
      or iFOBT associated with a reduction in CRC and overall mortality?What are the
      sensitivity and specificity of gFOBT and iFOBT for the detection of 1) CRC and 2)
      large polyps (>/= 1 cm)? CLINICAL NEED: CRC is the most common cause of
      non-tobacco related cancer death in Canada. It has been estimated that in 2007,
      7,800 people were diagnosed with CRC in Ontario and 3,250 died from the disease, 
      making the province's incidence and mortality rate of CRC amongst the highest in 
      the world. DESCRIPTION OF TECHNOLOGY/THERAPY: THERE ARE TWO GENERAL TYPES OF FOBT
      THAT ARE CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO THE ANALYTE DETECTED: guaiac FOBT (gFOBT) and
      immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT). Blood in the stool is a nonspecific finding but may 
      originate from CRC or larger (>1 cm) polyps (small adenomatous polyps do not tend
      to bleed). Bleeding from cancers and larger polyps may be intermittent and not
      always detectable in a single sample. The FOBT thus requires regular testing that
      consists of collecting specimens from consecutive bowel movements. A positive
      gFOBT or iFOBT involves a diagnostic workup with colonoscopy to examine the
      entire colon in order to rule out the presence of cancer or advanced neoplasia.
      METHODS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted from
      January 2003 to June 2008 that included OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and
      Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied
      Health Literature (CINAHL), The Cochrane Library, and the International Agency
      for Health Technology Assessment/Centre for Review and Dissemination. INCLUSION
      CRITERIA: Patients at average risk for CRCAll patients must be at least 50 years 
      of ageBiennial FOBT as a screening modality and use of colonoscopy as the
      reference standardSystematic reviews and randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      OUTCOMES: CRC mortality, overall mortality, sensitivity, specificity, adverse
      effects EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies involving fewer than 100 patientsStudies that
      do not report sufficient data for analysis COMPARISONS OF INTEREST: Evidence
      exists for these comparisons of interest: gFOBT compared with the reference "gold
      standard" colonoscopy (or double-contrast barium enema where colonoscopy is
      incomplete or contraindicated)iFOBT compared with the reference gold standard
      colonoscopy (or DCBE where colonoscopy is incomplete or contraindicated)gFOBT
      compared with iFOBTThe quality of the diagnostic studies was examined according
      to the 'GRADE Working Group criteria' for grading quality of evidence and
      strength of recommendations for diagnostic tests and strategies. SUMMARY OF
      FINDINGS: SINGLE-TEST STUDIES: There is limited direct/indirect evidence that
      iFOBT has sensitivity/specificity superior to that of unrehydrated gFOBT for CRC 
      detection: sensitivity for gFOBT:13% and 25%pooled iFOBT sensitivity:81%There is 
      evidence that iFOBT and gFOBT have lower sensitivities for adenoma detection than
      for CRC detection: sensitivity for rehydrated gFOBT22%pooled iFOBT sensitivity28%
      REPEATED-TEST STUDIES: No trials have examined CRC mortality outcomes after
      repeated testing of iFOBT. Two RCTs from the United Kingdom and Denmark showed
      significant reduction in CRC mortality using unrehydrated gFOBT biennially
      Relative risk reductions of 13% (UK trial) and 16% (Danish trial); absolute
      difference of 0.1% (UK trial) and 0.2% (Danish trial).No significant reduction in

TI  - Foucault on methadone: beyond biopower.
PG  - 450-2
LID - 10.1016/j.drugpo.2008.10.005 [doi]
AB  - This essay reviews four texts which critically analyse methadone maintenance
      therapy using Foucault as a key theoretical framework: [Friedman, J., & Alicea,
      M. (2001). Surviving heroin: Interviews with women in methadone clinics. Florida:
      University Press of Florida], [Bourgois, P. (2000). Disciplining addictions: The 
      bio-politics of methadone and heroin in the United States. Culture Medicine and
      Psychiatry, 24, 165-195], [Bull, M. (2008). Governing the heroin trade: From
      treaties to treatment. Ashgate: Aldershot], and [Fraser, S., & valentine, k.
      (2008). Substance & substitution: Methadone subjects in liberal societies. New
      York: Palgrave Macmillan]. Taken together these works demonstrate one trajectory 
      in the development of critical drug studies over the past decade. While all four 
      view MMT as a regulatory technology which aims to create productive and obedient 
      subjects, their understandings of the power relations of the clinic are quite
      distinct. The first two texts emphasise the social control of drug users, the
      third, issues of governmentality and liberal political practice, while the fourth
      engages with ontological questions about substances themselves. Thus while
      Foucauldian analysis has become familiar in social studies of drugs and alcohol, 
      new uses for its conceptual tools continue to emerge.

TI  - Vulnerability and non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIV patients,
      Minas Gerais State, Brazil.
PG  - 2603-13
LID - S0102-311X2008001100015 [pii]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe vulnerability profiles and to verify
      their association with non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among 295
      HIV-patients receiving their first prescription in two public-referral centers in
      Minas Gerais States, Brazil. The cumulative incidence of non-adherence was 36.9%.
      Three pure vulnerability profiles (lower, medium and higher) were identified
      based on the Grade of Membership method (GoM). Pure type patients of the "higher 
      vulnerability" profile had, when compared to the overall sample, an increased
      probability of being younger, not understanding the need of ART, having a
      personal reason to be HIV-tested, not disclosing their HIV status, having more
      than one (non-regular) sexual partner, reporting use of alcohol, tobacco and
      illicit drugs, and having sex among men. Non-adherence to ART was statistically
      associated (p < 0.001) with this profile. Also, the heterogeneity of the sample
      was found to be high, since over 40% were mixed type. The implications are that
      health staff should be trained to develop strategies for incorporating
      risk-reduction interventions, bearing in mind the three dimensions of
      vulnerability and the diversity of those patients initiating antiretroviral
      therapy.

TI  - Preventing chronic disease risk factors: rationale and feasibility.
PG  - 745-50
AB  - SUMMARY OBJECTIVE: The majority of the mortality, morbidity, and disability in
      the United States and other developed countries is due to chronic diseases. These
      diseases could be prevented to a great extent with the elimination of four root
      causes: physical inactivity, poor nutrition, smoking, and hazardous drinking. The
      objective of this analysis was to determine whether efficacious risk factor
      prevention interventions exist and to examine the evidence that population-wide
      program implementation is justified. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a
      literature search for meta-analyses and systematic reviews of trials that tested 
      interventions to increase physical activity, improve nutrition, reduce smoking
      and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and reduce hazardous drinking.
      RESULTS: We found that appropriately designed interventions can produce
      behavioral change for the four behaviors. Effective interventions included
      tailored fact-to-face counseling, phone counseling, and computerized tailored
      feedback. Computer-based health behavior assessment with feedback and education
      was documented to be an effective method of determining behavior, assessing
      participant interest in behavior change and delivering interventions. Some
      programs have documented reduced health care costs associated with intervention. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Positive results to date suggest that further investments to improve
      the effectiveness and efficiency of chronic disease risk factor prevention
      programs are warranted. Widespread implementation of these programs could have a 
      significant impact on chronic disease incidence rates and costs of health care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors affect alcohol counselling practices among 
      medical students. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Nationally representative
      medical schools (n=16) in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Medical students who
      graduated in 2003. INTERVENTIONS: Questionnaires were completed (response rate
      83%) at the start of students' first year (n=1846/2080), entrance to wards
      (typically during the third year of training) (n=1630/1982), and their final
      (fourth) year (n=1469/1901). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Previously validated
      questions on alcohol consumption and counselling. RESULTS: 78% (3777/4847) of
      medical students reported drinking in the past month, and a third (1668/ 4847)
      drank excessively; these proportions changed little over time. The proportion of 
      those who believed alcohol counselling was highly relevant to care of patients
      was higher at entrance to wards (61%; 919/1516) than in final year students (46%;
      606/1329). Although students intending to enter primary care were more likely to 
      believe alcohol counselling was highly relevant, only 28% of final year students 
      (391/1393) reported usually or always talking to their general medical patients
      about their alcohol consumption. Excessive drinkers were somewhat less likely
      than others to counsel patients or to think it relevant to do so. In multivariate
      models, extensive training in alcohol counselling doubled the frequency of
      reporting that alcohol counselling would be clinically relevant (odds ratio 2.3, 
      95% confidence interval 1.6 to 3.3) and of reporting doing counselling (2.2, 1.5 
      to 3.3). CONCLUSIONS: Excessive drinking and binge drinking among US medical
      students is common, though somewhat less prevalent than among comparably aged
      adults in the US general population. Few students usually discussed alcohol use
      with patients, but greater training and confidence about alcohol counselling
      predicted both practising and believing in the relevance of alcohol counselling. 
      Medical schools should consider routinely training students to screen and counsel
      patients for alcohol misuse and consider discouraging excessive drinking.

AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of topiramate with naltrexone in the treatment of
      alcohol dependence. DESIGN: The investigation was a double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 12-week study carried out at the University of Sao Paulo,
      Brazil. SAMPLE: A total of 155 patients, 18-60 years of age, with an
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol
      dependence. METHODS: After a 1-week detoxification period, patients were assigned
      randomly to receive topiramate (induction to 300 mg/day), naltrexone (50 mg/day) 
      or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Time to first relapse (consumption of >60 g ethyl
      alcohol), cumulative abstinence duration and weeks of heavy drinking. FINDINGS:
      In intention-to-treat analyses, topiramate was statistically superior to placebo 
      on a number of measures including time to first relapse (7.8 versus 5.0 weeks),
      cumulative abstinence duration (8.2 versus 5.6 weeks), weeks of heavy drinking
      (3.4 versus 5.9) and percentage of subjects abstinent at 4 weeks (67.3 versus
      42.6) and 8 weeks (61.5 versus 31.5), but not 12 weeks (46.2 versus 27.8).
      RESULTS: remained significant after controlling for Alcoholics Anonymous
      attendance, which was higher in topiramate than in other groups. There were no
      significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus
      topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when
      compared to topiramate. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the
      efficacy of topiramate in the relapse prevention of alcoholism. Suggestive
      evidence was also obtained for superiority of topiramate versus naltrexone, but
      this needs to be verified in future research with larger sample sizes.

TI  - Ultra-brief intervention for problem drinkers: research protocol.
PG  - 298
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-8-298 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Helping the large number of problem drinkers who will never seek
      treatment is a challenging issue. Public health initiatives employing educational
      materials or mass media campaigns have met with mixed success. However, clinical 
      research has developed effective brief interventions to help problem drinkers.
      This project will employ an intervention that has been validated in clinical
      settings and then modified into an ultra-brief format suitable for use as a
      public health intervention. The major objective of this study is to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial to establish the effectiveness of an ultra-brief,
      personalized feedback intervention for problem drinkers. METHODS/DESIGN: Problem 
      drinkers recruited on a baseline population telephone survey conducted in a major
      metropolitan city in Canada will be randomized to one of three conditions - a
      personalized feedback pamphlet condition, a control pamphlet condition, or a no
      intervention control condition. In the week after the baseline survey, households
      in the two pamphlet conditions will be sent their respective pamphlets. Changes
      in drinking will be assessed post intervention at three-month and six-month
      follow-ups. Drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental conditions
      using Structural Equation Modeling. The primary hypothesis is that problem
      drinkers from households who receive the personalized feedback pamphlet
      intervention will display significantly improved drinking outcomes at three and
      six-month follow-ups as compared to problem drinkers from households in the no
      intervention control condition. Secondary hypotheses will test the impact of the 
      intervention on help seeking, and explore the mediating or moderating role of
      perceived drinking norms, perceived alcohol risks and the problem drinker's
      social reasons for drinking. DISCUSSION: This trial will provide information on
      the effectiveness of a pamphlet-based personalized feedback intervention for
      problem drinkers in a community setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov
      registration #NCT00688584.

PG  - 1660-70
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02274.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: To examine the efficacy of two adolescent drug abuse treatments: individual 
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and multidimensional family therapy (MDFT).
      DESIGN: A 2 (treatment condition) x 4 (time) repeated-measures intent-to-treat
      randomized design. Data were gathered at baseline, termination, 6 and 12 months
      post-termination. Analyses used latent growth curve modeling. SETTING:
      Community-based drug abuse clinic in the northeastern United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 224 youth, primarily male (81%), African American (72%),
      from low-income single-parent homes (58%) with an average age of 15 years were
      recruited into the study. All youth were drug users, with 75% meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for cannabis dependence and 13% meeting criteria for abuse.
      MEASUREMENTS: Five outcomes were measured: (i) substance use problem severity;
      (ii) 30-day frequency of cannabis use; (iii) 30-day frequency of alcohol use;
      (iv) 30-day frequency of other drug use; and (v) 30-day abstinence. FINDINGS:
      Both treatments produced significant decreases in cannabis consumption and
      slightly significant reductions in alcohol use, but there were no treatment
      differences in reducing frequency of cannabis and alcohol use. Significant
      treatment effects were found favoring MDFT on substance use problem severity,
      other drug use and minimal use (zero or one occasion of use) of all substances,
      and these effects continued to 12 months following treatment termination.
      CONCLUSION: Both interventions are promising treatments. Consistent with previous
      controlled trials, MDFT is distinguished by the sustainability of treatment
      effects.

PG  - 1315-25
LID - 10.1080/10826080801922082 [doi]
AB  - This investigation evaluated the effect of expressive writing on weight gain in
      young adults being treated for smoking cessation. This study was conducted
      between July 2001 and June 2005. Participants (N = 196) ages 18-24 years (M =
      20.8, SD = 2.0 years), who were recruited from a large city in the southeastern
      United States were randomized to brief office intervention or expressive writing 
      plus brief office intervention. The sample was 56% female, 93% Caucasian, smoked 
      a mean of 18.1 cigarettes per day (SD = 6.1), and had a mean body mass index of
      24.9 (SD = 5.6). Participants who received the expressive writing plus brief
      office intervention gained significantly less weight than those receiving the
      brief office interventions from week 3 to 24, but did not significantly differ at
      week 52. A limitation of this investigation relates to the fact that the impact
      of expressive writing on weight was an unanticipated treatment effect that was
      evaluated in post-hoc analyses. Although the findings suggest that expressive
      writing holds promise as a treatment adjunct to decrease weight gain associated
      with smoking cessation, further research is warranted.

TI  - Update on pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation.
PG  - 994-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on the efficacy and safety of pharmacologic and
      nonpharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: MEDLINE,
      EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for
      randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews (level I
      evidence) pertinent to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic smoking cessation
      therapies. MAIN MESSAGE: Pharmacologic smoking cessation aids are recommended for
      all smokers trying to quit, unless contraindicated. A new pharmacologic smoking
      cessation aid, varenicline, is now available in Canada. Level I evidence at
      1-year follow-up indicates that it is effective for smoking cessation. Adverse
      effects include nausea, insomnia, and abnormal dreaming. Nausea is mild or
      moderate and decreases over time. Varenicline is more effective than placebo or
      bupropion. Counseling also increases the likelihood of achieving cessation.
      CONCLUSION: Preliminary data indicate that varenicline is more effective than

TI  - Changes in readiness to quit and self-efficacy among adolescents receiving a
      brief office intervention for smoking cessation.
PG  - 326-36
LID - 10.1080/13548500701426703 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine changes in readiness to quit and self-efficacy among
      adolescents who received a clinic-based, brief office intervention (BOI) for
      smoking cessation. METHODS: This study utilized a prospective, pre-post-
      treatment design. Participants were adolescent smokers (34 females, 35 males)
      with a mean +/- SD age of 15.8 +/- 1.4 years; 86% were Caucasian, who were
      randomly assigned to receive the BOI as part of a larger clinical trial. They
      were recruited from three cities in the Midwest and Northeastern part of the
      United States. After the baseline assessment, the BOI was designed for
      adolescents to receive four weekly individual sessions with a research counselor 
      lasting between 10 and 40 min each. The BOI includes motivational interviewing
      and cognitive-behavioral techniques. Readiness to quit was assessed at each
      treatment session using the stages of change algorithm. The validated Adolescent 
      Smoking Self-Efficacy Scale (SES) was used to assess self-efficacy at baseline
      (week 0) prior to the intervention and at post-treatment (week 4). The SES items 
      comprise three factors or subscales: opportunities to smoke, emotional stress,
      and friends' influence. RESULTS: The percentage of adolescents who made
      improvement on readiness to quit from the baseline treatment session was
      statistically significant (p < .001) for each of the three subsequent treatment
      sessions. Self-efficacy scores increased significantly (p < .004) from baseline
      to post-treatment for all three subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents receiving a
      BOI progressed in their readiness and self-efficacy to quit. Understanding the
      change process among adolescent smokers during treatment could influence the
      design of future stop smoking interventions.

TI  - Canadian consensus practice guidelines for bisphosphonate associated
      osteonecrosis of the jaw.
PG  - 1391-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Following publication of the first reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw
      (ONJ) in patients receiving bisphosphonates in 2003, a call for national
      multidisciplinary guidelines based upon a systematic review of the current
      evidence was made by the Canadian Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons 
      (CAOMS) in association with national and international societies concerned with
      ONJ. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide recommendations regarding
      diagnosis, identification of at-risk patients, and prevention and management
      strategies, based on current evidence and consensus. These guidelines were
      developed for medical and dental practitioners as well as for oral pathologists
      and related specialists. METHODS: The multidisciplinary task force established by
      the CAOMS reviewed all relevant areas of research relating to ONJ associated with
      bisphosphonate use and completed a systematic review of current literature. These
      evidence-based guidelines were developed utilizing a structured development
      methodology. A modified Delphi consensus process enabled consensus among the
      multidisciplinary task force members. These guidelines have since been reviewed
      by external experts and endorsed by national and international medical, dental,
      oral surgery, and oral pathology societies. RESULTS: RECOMMENDATIONS regarding
      diagnosis, prevention, and management of ONJ were made following analysis of all 
      current data pertaining to this condition. ONJ has many etiologic factors
      including head and neck irradiation, trauma, periodontal disease, local
      malignancy, chemotherapy, and glucocorticoid therapy. High-dose intravenous
      bisphosphonates have been identified as a risk factor for ONJ in the oncology
      patient population. Low-dose bisphosphonate use in patients with osteoporosis or 
      other metabolic bone disease has not been causally linked to the development of
      ONJ. Prevention, staging, and treatment recommendations are based upon collective
      expert opinion and current data, which has been limited to case reports, case
      series, surveys, retrospective studies, and 2 prospective observational studies. 
      RECOMMENDATIONS: In all oncology patients, a thorough dental examination
      including radiographs should be completed prior to the initiation of intravenous 
      bisphosphonate therapy. In this population, any invasive dental procedure is
      ideally completed prior to the initiation of high-dose bisphosphonate therapy.
      Non-urgent procedures are preferably delayed for 3 to 6 months following
      interruption of bisphosphonate therapy. Osteoporosis patients receiving oral or
      intravenous bisphosphonates do not require a dental examination prior to
      initiating therapy in the presence of appropriate dental care and good oral
      hygiene. Stopping smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and maintaining good oral
      hygiene should be emphasized for all patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy.
      Individuals with established ONJ are most appropriately managed with supportive
      care including pain control, treatment of secondary infection, removal of
      necrotic debris, and mobile sequestrate. Aggressive debridement is
      contraindicated. CONCLUSION: Our multidisciplinary guidelines, which provide a
      rational evidence-based approach to the diagnosis, prevention, and management of 
      bisphosphonate-associated ONJ in Canada, are based on the best available
      published data and the opinion of national and international experts involved in 
      the prevention and management of ONJ.

TI  - Effects of an intervention brochure on emergency department patients' safe
      alcohol use and knowledge.
PG  - 561-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jemermed.2008.03.003 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States,
      contributing to over 100,000 deaths and costing society over 185 billion dollars 
      each year. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the
      American College of Emergency Physician's brief alcohol use intervention brochure
      on patients' hazardous drinking behavior and knowledge of safe alcohol use. We
      conducted a controlled trial comparing Emergency Department (ED) subjects
      receiving the alcohol use intervention brochure vs. receiving no brochure.
      One-month outcome measures included the following: 1) change in days of hazardous
      drinking; 2) change in knowledge of safe alcohol use; and 3) movement along a
      readiness-to-change continuum for excessive alcohol use. Of 277 subjects, 252
      (91.0%) agreed to participate, and 188 of these (74.6%) were successfully
      contacted for 1-month follow-up assessment. We did not find any significant
      decreases in days of hazardous drinking or increases in knowledge of safe
      drinking limits for either the intervention or comparison groups. However, among 
      the subgroup of excessive alcohol users (n = 100), we found that significantly
      more intervention subjects had advanced along the readiness-to-change continuum
      than comparison subjects (p < 0.01). This effect was even greater among the
      intervention group subjects who stated that they read the brochure (p < 0.001). A
      brief alcohol use intervention brochure does not affect ED patients' hazardous
      drinking behavior or knowledge of safe alcohol use. The brochure, however, may
      affect certain patients' motivation to change their drinking behavior. Changing
      drinking behavior requires more than simply handing out a brochure in the ED;
      referral to community resources for those motivated to change is likely an
      important component to successful management of this problem.

TI  - Epidemiology of genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection among young women in
      Costa Rica.
PG  - 461-8
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3181644b4c [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) epidemiology among 5829
      women 18 to 25 years old, in Costa Rica. METHODS: Data are from a community-based
      human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine trial. Before randomization, eligible women
      who reported previous sexual activity were interviewed and tested for Ct DNA by
      Hybrid Capture 2 and polymerase chain reaction-based genotyping. Multivariate
      models were developed. RESULTS: Overall prevalence was 14.2% (95% confidence
      interval, 13.3-15.1). Among Ct genotypes, serovar E was the most common (4.3%),
      followed by serovar F (3.0%), serovar D/Da (2.9%), and serovar I/Ia (2.1%).Ct
      increased with lifetime sexual partners of the women, and among women with 1
      lifetime partner, with sexual partners of the partner. Current intrauterine
      device users had an increase in Ct detection [odds ratio (OR) 1.6, 1.1-2.5] but
      hormonal contraceptives or condom users did not. Miscarriages were associated
      with a reduction in Ct detection (OR 0.7, 0.5-1.0) while current regular smoking 
      increased it (OR 1.7, 1.2-2.5). Vaginal discharge, reactive changes, ASCUS or
      LSIL and moderate to severe inflammation in the cytology were significantly more 
      common among Ct positive women (P <0.001). Gonorrhea prevalence was 0.8%, and it 
      was, as other STIs, highly correlated with Ct detection. CONCLUSIONS: This is a
      high-prevalence population where we confirmed the strong link between Ct and
      sexual behavior of women and their partners. The establishment of a screening
      program in the age group included in this study should be considered. More
      studies are needed in developing countries to further investigate the role of
      intrauterine devices and the lack of protection by condoms, in addition to the
      interplay between Ct and other STIs, ectopy, inflammation, and epithelial
      abnormalities.

TI  - A randomized, controlled trial of smoking cessation counseling provided during
      child hospitalization for respiratory illness.
PG  - 561-6
LID - 10.1002/ppul.20810 [doi]
AB  - The impact of parental smoking on children is enormous. Injury and illness
      related to parental smoking result in 6,200 excess pediatric deaths per year,
      which places smoking as the leading preventable cause of death in US children.
      Parental smoking doubles the risk of child hospitalization for respiratory
      illness therefore pediatricians have frequent contact with smoking parents. A
      single study has previously investigated the effect of child hospitalization on
      parental smoking cessation. Smoking caregivers of children hospitalized for
      respiratory illness at the University of New Mexico were offered a smoking
      cessation intervention during the child's hospitalization. Participants were
      randomized to receive either a brief anti-smoking message or more extensive
      counseling based on current clinical practice guidelines. Forty-two parents
      enrolled in the study. Fourteen percent of participants in the counseling group
      and 5% in the brief message group were self-reported quitters at 6 months. A
      significant percentage of smoking parents of children hospitalized for
      respiratory illness are willing to receive smoking cessation counseling while
      their child is in the hospital. Abstinence rates appear similar to other
      pediatric office-based interventions. Child hospitalization should be considered 
      an important opportunity to provide parents with smoking cessation services,
      particularly since many smoking parents will not have access to these services
      elsewhere.

TI  - Alcohol screening and brief counseling in a primary care hypertensive population:
      a quality improvement intervention.
PG  - 1271-80
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02199.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To determine the effect of an intervention to improve alcohol screening and
      brief counseling for hypertensive patients in primary care. DESIGN: Two-year
      randomized, controlled trial. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one primary care
      practices across the United States with a common electronic medical record.
      INTERVENTION: To promote alcohol screening and brief counseling. Intervention
      practices received site visits from study personnel and were invited to annual
      network meetings to review the progress of the project and share improvement
      strategies. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures included rates of documented
      alcohol screening in hypertensive patients and brief counseling administered in
      those diagnosed with high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence.
      Secondary outcomes included change in blood pressure among patients with these
      diagnoses. FINDINGS: Hypertensive patients in intervention practices were
      significantly more likely to have been screened after 2 years than hypertensive
      patients in control practices [64.5% versus 23.5%; adjusted odds ratio (OR) =
      8.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-38.2; P < 0.0087]. Patients in intervention
      practices diagnosed with high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence 
      were more likely than those in control practices to have had alcohol counseling
      documented (50.5% versus 29.6%; adjusted OR = 5.5, 95% CI 1.3-23.3). Systolic
      (adjusted mean decline = 4.2 mmHg, P = 0.036) and diastolic (adjusted mean
      decline = 3.3 mmHg, P = 0.006) blood pressure decreased significantly among
      hypertensive patients receiving alcohol counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Primary care
      practices receiving an alcohol-focused intervention over 2 years improved rates
      of alcohol screening for their hypertensive population. Implementation of alcohol
      counseling for high-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence also
      improved and led to changes in patient blood pressures.

TI  - Weight gain among women during smoking cessation: testing the effects of a
      multifaceted program.
PG  - 99-105
AB  - Cigarette smoking continues to be the leading preventable cause of chronic
      illness in the United States. A high percentage of smokers attempt to quit each
      year; however, smoking cessation success rates are low. Adding an exercise
      program to traditional therapies can increase smoking cessation rates among
      women. An experimental design was used to test two hypotheses. The first was that
      women who engage in a multifaceted approach to smoking cessation that includes a 
      structured exercise program, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and weekly
      counseling sessions will experience less weight gain during an 8-week smoking
      cessation program and at the 4-month follow-up session than women who engage in
      NRT and weekly counseling sessions alone. The second was that women who engage in
      a structured exercise program with NRT and weekly counseling sessions will have
      higher smoking cessation rates at the end of the 8-week smoking cessation program
      and at the 4-month follow-up session than women who engage in NRT and weekly
      counseling sessions alone.

TI  - Canadian Thoracic Society recommendations for management of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease - 2008 update - highlights for primary care.
PG  - 1A-8A
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major respiratory illness in
      Canada that is preventable and treatable but unfortunately remains
      underdiagnosed. The purpose of the present article from the Canadian Thoracic
      Society is to provide up-to-date information so that patients with this condition
      receive optimal care that is firmly based on scientific evidence. Important
      summary messages for clinicians are derived from the more detailed Update
      publication and are highlighted throughout the document. Three key messages
      contained in the update are: use targeted screening spirometry to establish a
      diagnosis and initiate prompt management (including smoking cessation) of mild
      COPD; improve dyspnea and activity limitation in stable COPD using new
      evidence-based treatment algorithms; and understand the importance of preventing 
      and managing acute exacerbations, particularly in moderate to severe disease.

TI  - [Hepatitis B and C among injecting drug users living with HIV in Sao Paulo,
      Brazil].
PG  - 57-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of injecting drug users living with HIV/AIDS
      and estimate hepatitis B and hepatitis C prevalence rates within this group.
      METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted with 205 injecting drug users living
      with HIV/AIDS receiving attention in three public health clinics in the city of
      Sao Paulo, in 2003. A non-probabilistic sample of volunteers was selected
      consecutively on the days respondents appeared for their appointments at the
      clinics. Personal data and information on sexual behavior, drug use and knowledge
      of hepatitis was collected through interviews. Tests were conducted to detect
      infections of the hepatitis B and C viruses. RESULTS: Out of the interviewees,
      81% were men and 19% women, with an average age of 39 (SD=6.1) and six years of
      formal education (SD=2.0). There was no difference in marital status between the 
      sexes, of which 48% were single, 42% were married, and 8% were divorced. The
      average ages for first use of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs were 13, 15 and 
      18, respectively. Hepatitis B and C prevalence were 55% (95% CI: 49;63) and
      83%(95% CI: 78;88), respectively. Eighty percent of respondents had not heard of 
      Hepatitis B and C prior to the first time they used injecting drugs. CONCLUSIONS:
      The high prevalence rates of Hepatitis B and C and low level of knowledge
      regarding the diseases justify the inclusion of information about hepatitis
      infections and the hepatitis B vaccines in HIV harm reduction strategies.

TI  - Prevalence of fetal ethanol exposure in a regional population-based sample by
      meconium analysis of fatty acid ethyl esters.
PG  - 239-45
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318167cfe5 [doi]
AB  - Challenges in identifying children exposed prenatally to ethanol necessitate the 
      development of a biomarker for neonates at risk for fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorder. Meconium fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE), products of nonoxidative
      ethanol metabolism, have been established as a novel biomarker of fetal ethanol
      exposure. We present the first application of this biomarker to a
      population-based sample in Canada. Six-hundred eighty-two meconium specimens were
      anonymously collected in the region of Grey Bruce, Ontario, Canada. Meconium FAEE
      were extracted by liquid-liquid and solid-phase extraction and analyzed by gas
      chromatography with flame-ionization detection confirmed by gas chromatography
      with mass spectrometry. We measured ethyl palmitate (E16:0), ethyl palmitoleate
      (E16:1), ethyl stearate (E18:0), ethyl oleate (E18:1), ethyl linoleate (E18:2),
      ethyl linolenate (E18:3), and ethyl arachidonate (E20:4). Seventeen of 682
      meconium samples tested positive for significant prenatal ethanol exposure (>2.0 
      nmol/g). FAEE analysis detected fivefold more ethanol-exposed pregnancies than
      standard postpartum questionnaires in this population (2.5% versus 0.5%) (P <
      0.001). The prevalence of ethanol-exposed pregnancies was consistent with Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention estimates of "frequent" prenatal drinking and 
      previously published estimates of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder disease
      prevalence in the general North American population. The FAEE concentrations of
      negative (95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.49 nmol/g) versus positive (95%
      confidence interval, 7.74-151.28 nmol/g) samples were distinct, further
      demonstrating the specificity of this biomarker in determining significant
      prenatal ethanol exposure. Meconium FAEE analysis demonstrates a fivefold
      increase in sensitivity over currently used methods of self-report-based
      screening in Ontario for the detection of ethanol-exposed pregnancies in a
      clinical setting.

TI  - Prevention of "risky" drinking among students at a Brazilian university.
PG  - 470-6
LID - 10.1093/alcalc/agn019 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper was to compare the quantity and frequency of alcohol
      use and its associated negative consequences between two groups of college
      students who were identified as being "risky drinkers." Subjects were randomly
      allocated in a clinical trial to intervention or control groups. METHODS: Risky
      drinking use was defined as Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT)
      >or=8 and/or Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI) >or=5 problems in the previous 
      year. Students who had undergone the Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for
      College Students (BASICS) (N = 145 at baseline; 142 at 12 months, and 103 at 24
      months, loss of 29.7%) were compared with a control group (N = 121 at baseline;
      121 at 12 months and 113 at 24 months, loss of 9.3%), the nonintervention group. 
      Variables included drinking frequency, quantity and peak consumption, dependence 
      assessment, and family and friends' abuse assessment. RESULTS: Treated students
      at a 24-month follow-up decreased quantity of alcohol use per occasion and
      lowered AUDIT and RAPI scores. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first brief intervention 
      work on risky drinking with college students in Brazil and the results are
      encouraging. However, it is difficult to conduct individual prevention strategies
      in a country where culture fosters heavy drinking through poor public policy on
      alcohol and lack of law enforcement.

TI  - Changes in lifestyle after hypertension diagnosis in Canada.
PG  - 199-204
AB  - Lifestyle modification should be an important part of therapy when hypertension
      is first diagnosed, with or without starting antihypertensive medication. The
      objective of the present study was to determine the extent to which recently
      diagnosed hypertensive Canadians modify their lifestyles and to examine how
      lifestyle modification relates to antihypertensive medication use. The
      longitudinal National Population Health Survey in Canada was conducted between
      1994 and 2002, including five interview cycles at two-year intervals. During this
      time, 1281 persons reported hypertension in one cycle but not in the previous
      cycle, and were considered to be new hypertensive patients. Information collected
      included body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity and
      medication use. The main lifestyle modification associated with newly diagnosed
      hypertensive patients was smoking cessation, with a 18.6% relative risk reduction
      (RRR). A smaller change was seen in decreasing physical inactivity (RRR 6.2%).
      Persons not taking antihypertensive medication were not more likely to make
      lifestyle improvements. Paradoxically, new hypertensive patients showed increased
      numbers in the obese category (RRR -9.6%). Weight gain was especially marked
      among antihypertensive medication users and largest in female beta-blocker users 
      (RRR -36.6%). If confirmed, this needs to be considered when prescribing to
      overweight people. In general, a greater effort is required to manage
      hypertension by lifestyle risk modification with or without antihypertensive
      medication.

TI  - Screening for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using spirometry: summary of 
      the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 535-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading
      cause of death in the United States. Fewer than half of the estimated 24 million 
      Americans with airflow obstruction have received a COPD diagnosis, and diagnosis 
      often occurs in advanced stages of the disease. PURPOSE: To summarize the
      evidence on screening for COPD using spirometry for the U.S. Preventive Services 
      Task Force (USPSTF). DATA SOURCES: English-language articles identified in PubMed
      and the Cochrane Library through January 2007, recent systematic reviews, expert 
      suggestions, and reference lists of retrieved articles. STUDY SELECTION: Explicit
      inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for each of the 8 key questions on
      benefits and harms of screening. Eligible study types varied by question. DATA
      EXTRACTION: Studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using
      predefined USPSTF criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Pharmacologic treatments for COPD
      reduce acute exacerbations in patients with severe disease. However, severe COPD 
      is uncommon in the general U.S. population. Spirometry has not been shown to
      independently increase smoking cessation rates. Potential harms from screening
      include false-positive results and adverse effects from subsequent unnecessary
      therapy. Data on the prevalence of airflow obstruction in the U.S. population
      were used to calculate projected outcomes from screening groups defined by age
      and smoking status. LIMITATION: No studies provide direct evidence on health
      outcomes associated with screening for COPD. CONCLUSION: Screening for COPD using
      spirometry is likely to identify a predominance of patients with mild to moderate
      airflow obstruction who would not experience additional health benefits if
      labeled as having COPD. Hundreds of patients would need to undergo spirometry to 
      defer a single exacerbation.

TI  - Improved care for patients with congestive heart failure.
PG  - 13-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Congestive heart failure (CHF) affects 4.9 million people, mostly
      elderly, in the United States; 550,000 new cases are diagnosed each year.
      Evidence-based treatment approaches offer opportunities to reduce mortality,
      complications, and rehospitalization rates. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE CARE FOR
      PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Seven key components of care tailored to 
      the patient's clinical condition and comorbidities that should be provided to all
      patients with CHF, in the absence of contraindications or intolerance: (1) left
      ventricular systolic function assessment, (2) angiotension-converting
      enzyme-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers at discharge for CHF patients
      with systolic dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%), (3)
      anticoagulation at discharge for CHF patients with chronic or recurrent atrial
      fibrillation, (4) smoking cessation advice and counseling, (5) discharge
      instructions that address activity level, diet, discharge medications, follow-up 
      appointment, weight monitoring, and what to do if symptoms worsen, (6) influenza 
      immunization (seasonal), and (7) pneumococcal immunization. Hospitals should also
      consider beta-blocker therapy at discharge for stabilized patients without
      contraindications. CONCLUSION: The 5 Million Lives Campaign's focus on delivering
      reliable, evidence-based care for patients with CHF is part of an overall
      strategy to reduce medically induced harm.

TI  - Alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral in the emergency department: 
      an implementation study.
PG  - 11-9
LID - 10.1016/j.jen.2007.03.019 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alcohol is the single greatest contributor to injury in the United 
      States. Numerous studies have reported that a standardized screening, brief
      intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) intervention can effectively
      minimize future alcohol consumption, reduce injury recurrence, and decrease the
      number of repeat ED visits. To date, SBIRT studies have been conducted in
      settings in which physicians or research assistants carried out SBIRT. Little is 
      known about ED nurses carrying out SBIRT. The purpose of this study was to
      examine ED nurse training needs and identify both barriers to, and enablers of,
      SBIRT implementation in the emergency department. METHODS: Two coordinators from 
      each of the 5 ED sites selected for the study attended a 1-day SBIRT educational 
      session. Site coordinators then trained their staff nurses to conduct SBIRT. Site
      coordinators were surveyed at the midpoint and end of the 6-month implementation 
      study period. Patient data from each facility was collected. RESULTS: Ten site
      coordinators were trained and held subsequent training sessions with nursing
      staff in their respective emergency departments. All sites encountered barriers
      to implementation, but 2 of 5 sites were able to implement the SBIRT process
      fully by the end of the evaluation period. A total of 3265 patients were screened
      for alcohol use problems. Of those screened, 678 (21%) were classified as
      hazardous drinkers. Overall, 56% of the positive-screened patients received 3 to 
      5 minutes of a brief intervention. After the brief intervention, between 9% and
      82% of patients were referred for further care. DISCUSSION: The SBIRT process can
      be conducted successfully by emergency nurses. However, substantial operational
      barriers to widespread routine implementation exist. These barriers need to be
      addressed before emergency nurses incorporate SBIRT as routine part of ED care.

TI  - Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence
      (The COMBINE Study): examination of posttreatment drinking outcomes.
PG  - 5-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of pharmacological
      and behavioral interventions across 1 year posttreatment in the COMBINE
      (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study. METHOD:
      Alcohol-dependent individuals (N = 1,383; 428 women) recruited at 11 outpatient
      academic alcoholism-treatment clinics across the United States participated in a 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. They received 16 weeks of
      naltrexone (Revia) or acamprosate (Campral) or both medications and/or placebos
      in combination with medical management (MM), with or without combined behavioral 
      intervention (CBI); one group received CBI without pills or MM. Drinking behavior
      and clinical status were assessed at the end of treatment (Week 16) and at Weeks 
      26, 52, and 68. RESULTS: Prior treatment with active naltrexone, without active
      acamprosate or CBI or with active acamprosate plus CBI, and CBI with double
      placebo resulted in a significantly higher percentage of days abstinent than
      double placebos with no CBI (p < .05). Having received CBI was associated with
      positive clinical response posttreatment, compared with not having received CBI. 
      Prior treatment with naltrexone increased the time to the first heavy-drinking
      day posttreatment (p = .03). No differences were found between patients who had
      received CBI without MM or pills and those having received MM and double placebo 
      with or without CBI. No significant main effects for acamprosate were found on
      any of the outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Previous treatment with MM and either
      CBI or naltrexone, or both, but not acamprosate, was associated with sustained
      efficacy beyond discontinuation. Reasons for the maintained treatment gains with 
      naltrexone and/or CBI and potential methods to extend them are discussed.

TI  - Unhealthy behaviours for self-management of HIV-related peripheral neuropathy.
PG  - 1266-73
AB  - The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy is frequent in HIV disease and is often
      associated with antiretroviral therapy. Unhealthy behaviours, particularly
      substance-use behaviours, are utilized by many HIV-positive individuals to manage
      neuropathic symptoms. As part of a larger study on self-care for symptoms in HIV 
      disease, this study analyzed the prevalence and characteristics of unhealthy
      behaviours to self-manage peripheral neuropathy in HIV disease. Sociodemographic 
      and disease-related correlates and unhealthy behaviours were examined in a
      convenience sample of 1,217 respondents who were recruited from data collection
      sites in several US cities, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Taiwan. Results of the
      study indicated that respondents with peripheral neuropathy (n=450) identified a 
      variety of unhealthy self-care behaviours including injection drug use, oral drug
      use, smoking cigarettes and alcohol ingestion. Specific unhealthy behaviours that
      participants reported to alleviate peripheral neuropathy included use of
      marijuana (n=67), smoking cigarettes (n=139), drinking alcohol (n=81) and street 
      drugs (n=30). A subset of those individuals (n=160), who identified high levels
      of neuropathy (greater than five on a scale of 1-10), indicated significantly
      higher use of amphetamines and injection drug use in addition to alcohol use and 
      cigarette smoking. For participants from Norway, substance use (using alcohol:
      56%) was one of the most frequent self-management strategies. Implications for
      clinical practice include assessment and education of persons with HIV for
      self-care management of the complex symptom of peripheral neuropathy.

TI  - UK Alcohol Treatment Trial: client-treatment matching effects.
PG  - 228-38
AB  - AIM: To test a priori hypotheses concerning client-treatment matching in the
      treatment of alcohol problems and to evaluate the more general hypothesis that
      client-treatment matching adds to the overall effectiveness of treatment. DESIGN:
      Pragmatic, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial (the UK Alcohol Treatment
      Trial: UKATT) with open follow-up at 3 months after entry and blind follow-up at 
      12 months. SETTING: Five treatment centres, comprising seven treatment sites,
      including National Health Service (NHS), social services and joint
      NHS/non-statutory facilities. TREATMENTS: Motivational enhancement therapy and
      social behaviour and network therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Matching hypotheses were
      tested by examining interactions between client attributes and treatment types at
      both 3 and 12 months follow-up using the outcome variables of percentage days
      abstinent, drinks per drinking day and scores on the Alcohol Problems
      Questionnaire and Leeds Dependence Questionnaire. FINDINGS: None of five matching
      hypotheses was confirmed at either follow-up point on any outcome variable.
      CONCLUSION: The findings strongly support the conclusion reached in Project MATCH
      in the United States that client-treatment matching, at least of the kind
      examined, is unlikely to result in substantial improvements to the effectiveness 
      of treatment for alcohol problems. Possible reasons for this failure to support
      the general matching hypothesis are discussed, as are the implications of UKATT
      findings for the provision of treatment for alcohol problems in the United
      Kingdom.

      characteristics. DESIGN AND SETTING: Data from a recently released
      cross-sectional, nationally representative household survey, the United States
      National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) were
      analysed. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-three thousand ninety-three English speaking adults
      aged 18 years and over. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Dependence upon cocaine and other 
      illegal drug dependence, defined in two ways: "ungated" and "gated". "Ungated"
      dependence included all persons meeting criteria for DSM-IV dependence, without
      regard for DSM-IV drug abuse clinical features. "Gated" dependence required at
      least one feature of DSM-IV drug abuse. RESULTS: There was no statistically
      robust decrement in the estimated prevalence of cocaine or other drug dependence 
      using a "gated" assessment. Patterns of association of cocaine dependence with
      background characteristics were not appreciably different when the gated and
      ungated approaches were applied. CONCLUSIONS: In panoramic mental health surveys,
      the inefficiency of an ungated approach must be balanced against the anticipated 
      number of cases of dependence without associated social role impairments or harm.
      In this study, the reduction in the number of identified cocaine dependence cases
      appeared to be so small that even in a sample of over 40,000 participants,
      attenuation in population prevalence would prove difficult to detect.

TI  - Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in medicare beneficiaries.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has been shown to be
      beneficial and cost-effective for men aged 65-74. However, most screening studies
      have been conducted in Europe and Australia, where attendance for screening was
      higher than the single large U.S. study involving only veterans. The prevalence
      of AAA in the U.S. general population is not well defined, nor is the best method
      of recruitment for screening. Letters of invitation for a free screening
      ultrasound for AAA were sent to 30,000 randomly selected Medicare beneficiaries
      from the hospital referral region of three university-affiliated hospitals
      without restriction by age, gender, or comorbidity. Attendance for screening was 
      calculated by age, gender, and travel distance to the screening center. Telephone
      calls to a random sample of nonresponders were made to determine the reason for
      failure to attend. Prevalence of AAA by ultrasound and known risk factors for AAA
      (e.g., age, gender, smoking status) were determined. The attendance rate was 7%
      (2,005). Attendance was greater with male gender (p < 0.01), younger age (p <
      0.05), and decreased travel distance to the screening center (p < 0.05). The
      primary reasons for failure to attend included incorrect address or vital status,
      poor health, and lack of interest. Prevalence of previously undetected AAA was
      2.8% in men and 0.2% in women. AAA was predicted by smoking status and male
      gender (p < 0.01 for each). Unselected invitation of Medicare beneficiaries for
      ultrasound screening for AAA results in a low attendance and low yield of AAA.
      The prevalence estimates from this study may not reflect the entire Medicare
      population given the low attendance and may reflect the healthy habits of those
      most interested in screening. Patients should be selected for screening based on 
      their suitability for repair if an AAA is found as well as their risk factors for
      AAA. The best method of recruitment for screening of those most at risk for AAA
      in the United States remains to be determined.

TI  - Pre-conceptional vitamin/folic acid supplementation 2007: the use of folic acid
      in combination with a multivitamin supplement for the prevention of neural tube
      defects and other congenital anomalies.
PG  - 1003-26
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide information regarding the use of folic acid in combination 
      with a multivitamin supplement for the prevention of neural tube defects and
      other congenital anomalies, so that physicians, midwives, nurses, and other
      health care workers can assist in the education of women in the pre-conception
      phase of their health care. OPTION: Supplementation with folic acid and vitamins 
      is problematic, since 50% of pregnancies are unplanned, and women's health status
      may not be optimal when they conceive. OUTCOMES: Folic acid in combination with a
      multivitamin supplement has been associated with a decrease in specific birth
      defects. EVIDENCE: Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Database were searched for
      relevant English language articles published between 1985 and 2007. The previous 
      Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) Policy Statement of 
      November 1993 and statements from the American College of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology and Canadian College of Medical Geneticists were also reviewed in
      developing this clinical practice guideline. VALUES: The quality of evidence was 
      rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on
      Preventive Health Care. BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Promoting the use of folic
      acid and a multivitamin supplement among women of reproductive age will reduce
      the incidence of birth defects. The costs are those of daily vitamin
      supplementation and eating a healthy diet. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Women in the
      reproductive age group should be advised about the benefits of folic acid in
      addition to a multivitamin supplement during wellness visits (birth control
      renewal, Pap testing, yearly examination) especially if pregnancy is
      contemplated. (III-A) 2. Women should be advised to maintain a healthy diet, as
      recommended in Eating Well With Canada's Food Guide (Health Canada). Foods
      containing excellent to good sources of folic acid are fortified grains, spinach,
      lentils, chick peas, asparagus, broccoli, peas, Brussels sprouts, corn, and
      oranges. However, it is unlikely that diet alone can provide levels similar to
      folate-multivitamin supplementation. (III-A) 3. Women taking a multivitamin
      containing folic acid should be advised not to take more than one daily dose of
      vitamin supplement, as indicated on the product label. (II-2-A) 4. Folic acid and
      multivitamin supplements should be widely available without financial or other
      barriers for women planning pregnancy to ensure the extra level of
      supplementation. (III-B) 5. Folic acid 5 mg supplementation will not mask vitamin
      B12 deficiency (pernicious anemia), and investigations (examination or
      laboratory) are not required prior to initiating supplementation. (II-2-A) 6. The
      recommended strategy to prevent recurrence of a congenital anomaly (anencephaly, 
      myelomeningocele, meningocele, oral facial cleft, structural heart disease, limb 
      defect, urinary tract anomaly, hydrocephalus) that has been reported to have a
      decreased incidence following preconception / first trimester folic acid +/-
      multivitamin oral supplementation is planned pregnancy +/- supplementation
      compliance. A folate-supplemented diet with additional daily supplementation of
      multivitamins with 5 mg folic acid should begin at least three months before
      conception and continue until 10 to 12 weeks post conception. From 12 weeks
      post-conception and continuing throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period
      (4-6 weeks or as long as breastfeeding continues), supplementation should consist
      of a multivitamin with folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg). (I-A) 7. The recommended
      strategy(ies) for primary prevention or to decrease the incidence of fetal
      congenital anomalies will include a number of options or treatment approaches
      depending on patient age, ethnicity, compliance, and genetic congenital anomaly
      risk status. OPTION A: Patients with no personal health risks, planned pregnancy,
      and good compliance require a good diet of folate-rich foods and daily
      supplementation with a multivitamin with folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg) for at least two
      to three months before conception and throughout pregnancy and the postpartum
      period (4-6 weeks and as long as breastfeeding continues). (II-2-A) OPTION B:
      Patients with health risks, including epilepsy, insulin dependent diabetes,
      obesity with BMI >35 kg/m2, family history of neural tube defect, belonging to a 
      high-risk ethnic group (e.g., Sikh) require increased dietary intake of
      folate-rich foods and daily supplementation, with multivitamins with 5 mg folic
      acid, beginning at least three months before conception and continuing until 10
      to 12 weeks post conception. From 12 weeks post-conception and continuing
      throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period (4-6 weeks or as long as
      breastfeeding continues), supplementation should consist of a multivitamin with
      folic acid (0.4-1.0 mg). (II-2-A) OPTION C: Patients who have a history of poor
      compliance with medications and additional lifestyle issues of variable diet, no 
      consistent birth control, and possible teratogenic substance use (alcohol,
      tobacco, recreational non-prescription drugs) require counselling about the
      prevention of birth defects and health problems with folic acid and multivitamin 
      supplementation. The higher dose folic acid strategy (5 mg) with multivitamin
      should be used, as it may obtain a more adequate serum red blood cell folate
      level with irregular vitamin / folic acid intake but with a minimal additional
      health risk. (III-B) 8. The Canadian Federal Government could consider an
      evaluation process for the benefit/risk of increasing the level of national folic
      acid flour fortification to 300 mg/100 g (present level 140 mg/100 g). (III-B) 9.
      The Canadian Federal Government could consider an evaluation process for the
      benefit/risk of additional flour fortification with multivitamins other than
      folic acid. (III-B) 10. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada
      will explore the possibility of a Canadian Consensus conference on the use of
      folic acid and multivitamins for the primary prevention of specific congenital
      anomalies. The conference would include Health Canada/Congenital Anomalies
      Surveillance, Canadian College of Medical Geneticists, Canadian Paediatric
      Society, Motherisk, and pharmaceutical industry representatives. VALIDATION: This
      is a revision of a previous guideline and information from other consensus
      reviews from medical and government publications has been used. SPONSOR: The
      Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

TI  - Tobacco cessation quitlines in North America: a descriptive study.
PG  - i9-15
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quitlines have become an integral part of tobacco control efforts in 
      the United States and Canada. The demonstrated efficacy and the convenience of
      telephone based counselling have led to the fast adoption of quitlines, to the
      point of near universal access in North America. However, information on how
      these quitlines operate in actual practice is not often readily available.
      OBJECTIVES: This study describes quitline practice in North America and examines 
      commonalities and differences across quitlines. It will serve as a source of
      reference for practitioners and researchers, with the aim of furthering service
      quality and promoting continued innovation. DESIGN: A self administered
      questionnaire survey of large, publicly funded quitlines in the United States and
      Canada. A total of 52 US quitlines and 10 Canadian quitlines participated.
      Descriptive statistics are provided regarding quitline operational structures,
      clinical services, quality assurance procedures, funding sources and utilisation 
      rates. RESULTS: Clinical services for the 62 state/provincial quitlines are
      supplied by a total of 26 service providers. Nine providers operate multiple
      quitlines, creating greater consistency in operation than would otherwise be
      expected. Most quitlines offer services over extended hours (mean 96 hours/week) 
      and have multiple language capabilities. Most (98%) use proactive multisession
      counselling-a key feature of protocols tested in previous experimental trials.
      Almost all quitlines have extensive training programmes (>60 hours) for
      counselling staff, and over 70% conduct regular evaluation of outcomes. About
      half of quitlines use the internet to provide cessation information. A little
      over a third of US quitlines distribute free cessation medications to eligible
      callers. The average utilisation rate of the US state quitlines in the 2004-5
      fiscal year was about 1.0% across states, with a strong correlation between the
      funding level of the quitlines and the smokers' utilisation of them (r = 0.74,
      p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Quitlines in North America display core commonalities:
      they have adopted the principles of multisession proactive counselling and they
      conduct regular outcome evaluation. Yet variations, tested and untested, exist.
      Standardised reporting procedures would be of benefit to the field. Shared
      discussion of the rationale behind variations can inform future decision making
      for all North American quitlines.

TI  - Evaluation of smoking cessation behaviors and interventions among Latino smokers 
      at low-income clinics in a US-Mexico border county.
PG  - 373-80
AB  - A descriptive study of 94 Latino smokers receiving nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) in US-Mexico border clinics in El Paso County, Texas was conducted. A
      baseline questionnaire and two follow-up telephone surveys (8-12 weeks and 6
      months) were administered to evaluate smoking habits, behaviors, and cessation
      interventions. Participants reported an average daily cigarette consumption of 15
      cigarettes and smoked within 30 min of waking (44%). Primary motivations for
      quitting were personal health (95%), family's health (74%), and doctor's advice
      (71%). Female smokers were more likely to smoke due to being anxious (p=0.012),
      not being able to sleep (p=0.02), or to feel thin (p=0.002). Male smokers were
      more likely to smoke when drinking alcohol (p=0.005). Nearly 40% of smokers
      reported they had never tried to quit before. Medication use at baseline was 82% 
      patch, 53% lozenge, 29% gum, and 24% bupropion (combination therapy permitted).
      At 8-12 weeks, nearly two-thirds of patients were quit and 44% remained quit at
      six months. Smoking habits, behaviors, and successful cessation interventions
      among Latinos in a US-Mexico border community were identified.

      with MDD, we used a combination of DSM IV- criteria interview and a questionnaire
      screen including the center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. We
      analyzed data from consecutive adult patients from hospitals in Argentina,
      Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico and described the demographic and health
      status differences between MDD and non-MDD patients. Prevalence of MDD ranges
      from 23.0 to 35.0%. The estimates are based on a total of 1,835 patients aged 18 
      years and over, with response rates of 83.0%. Compared to non-MDD patients, MDD
      patients were more likely to be middle-aged, female, smokers, of lower
      socioeconomic status, and to report a diagnosis of asthma or
      arthritis/rheumatism. Multivariate analysis identified a lower level of
      education, smoking, and self-reported anxiety, chronic fatigue, and back problems
      to be independently associated with MDD. Our data suggest that the prevalence of 
      MDD is elevated among emergency department patients in Latin American countries. 
      The integration of depression screening into routine emergency care merits
      serious consideration, especially if such screening can be linked to psychiatric 
      treatment.

TI  - The search for mechanisms of behavior change in evidence-based behavioral
      treatments for alcohol use disorders: overview.
PG  - 1s-3s
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past three decades, the main question of interest to alcohol
      treatment researchers has concerned the main effects of a particular behavioral
      intervention or what works. Increasingly, alcohol treatment researchers are
      turning their attention to the underlying psychological, social, and even
      neurophysiologic processes or "active ingredients" that are driving therapeutic
      change. METHOD: The articles contained in this supplement to Alcoholism: Clinical
      and Experimental Research grew out of invited presentations given at a one-day
      satellite session immediately preceding the 28th Annual Meeting of the Research
      Society on Alcoholism (RSA). The conference was a collaborative effort of the
      Center on Alcoholism, Substance Abuse, and Addiction at the University of New
      Mexico, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, Brown
      University, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National 
      Institutes of Health. RESULTS: The conference featured a mix of full-length
      presentations on conceptual and methodological issues, reports of original
      research findings, and lively discussion among speakers and conference
      participants. Understanding mechanisms of behavior change will benefit the field 
      by identifying the key aspects of therapy that must be present for maximum
      effect, irrespective of the specific technique being applied; provide a new way
      to approach patient-treatment interactions; and lay the groundwork for
      understanding how change is affected by social and other extratreatment factors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Although not a new topic to the field, understanding mechanisms of
      behavior change has begun to capture the interest of an increasing number of
      alcohol treatment researchers. Understanding behavior change is an exceedingly
      complex enterprise and innovative thinking and creative research designs will be 
      required to advance the field.

TI  - An exploratory analysis of treatment completion and client and organizational
      factors using hierarchical linear modeling.
PG  - 335-51
AB  - Data from the Alcohol and Drug Services Study (ADSS) are used to analyze the
      structure and operation of the substance abuse treatment industry in the United
      States. Published literature contains little systematic empirical analysis of the
      interaction between organizational characteristics and treatment outcomes. This
      paper addresses that deficit. It develops and tests a hierarchical linear model
      (HLM) to address questions about the empirical relationship between treatment
      inputs (industry costs, types and use of counseling and medical personnel,
      diagnosis mix, patient demographics, and the nature and level of services used in
      substance abuse treatment), and patient outcomes (retention and treatment
      completion rates). The paper adds to the literature by demonstrating a direct and
      statistically significant link between treatment completion and the
      organizational and staffing structure of the treatment setting. Related
      reimbursement issues, questions for future analysis, and limitations of the ADSS 
      for this analysis are discussed.

TI  - Trends in perimortal conditions and mortality rates among HIV-infected patients.
PG  - 2093-100
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe trends in perimortal conditions (pathological conditions 
      causing death or present at death but not necessarily the reported cause of
      death) during three periods related to the availability of HAART, pre-HAART
      (1992-1995), early HAART (1996-1999), and contemporary HAART (2000-2003); annual 
      mortality rates; and antiretroviral therapy (ART) prevalence during 1992-2003.
      DESIGN: Multicenter observational clinical cohort in the United States
      (Adult/Adolescent Spectrum of HIV Disease [ASD] project). METHODS: Proportionate 
      mortality for selected perimortal conditions, annual mortality rates, and ART
      prevalence were standardized by sex, race/ethnicity, age at death, HIV
      transmission category, and lowest CD4 cell count of ASD decedents. Multivariable 
      generalized linear regression was used to estimate trends in proportionate
      mortality, as linear trends through all three HAART periods, mortality rates, and
      ART prevalence. RESULTS: Of 9225 deaths, 58.6% occurred during 1992-1995, 29.5%
      during 1996-1999, and 11.9% during 2000-2003. Linear trends in proportionate
      mortality for noninfectious diseases (e.g., liver disease, hypertension, and
      alcohol abuse) increased significantly; proportionate mortality for AIDS-defining
      infectious diseases (e.g., pneumocystosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial disease, 
      and cytomegalovirus disease) decreased significantly. Mortality rates decreased
      from 487.5/1000 person-years in 1995 to 100.6 in 2002. Of 36 256 patients from
      ASD, 75.7% (standardized average) were prescribed ART annually. CONCLUSIONS:
      Among HIV-infected patients, the majority of whom were prescribed ART, the
      increasing trend in common noninfectious perimortal conditions support screening 
      and treatment for these conditions in order to sustain the trend in declining
      mortality rates.

PG  - 98-105
AB  - Adherence to evidence-based interventions for hospitalized cardiovascular disease
      patients is not optimal. This study assesses the impact of a national quality
      improvement program on adherence to guidelines in these patients. Data from 92
      hospitals from across the United States participating in the Get With The
      Guidelines program for at least 1 year for 11 acute and secondary prevention
      measures from a preintervention baseline period and the subsequent 4 quarters of 
      a quality improvement intervention were analyzed. A patient group of 45,988
      patients with acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization, or
      peripheral vascular disease was included in this evaluation. Significant
      improvement from baseline was seen in 10 of 11 measures by the fourth quarter:
      use of early aspirin for acute myocardial infarction, 76.4% to 88.0% (P <
      0.0001); early beta-blocker for acute myocardial infarction, 64.4% to 79.5% (P < 
      0.0001); beta-blocker at discharge, 75% to 82.1% (P < 0.0001); smoking cessation 
      counseling, 58.7% to 74.3% (P < 0.0001); angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor 
      use for acute myocardial infarction, 64.5% to 69.9% (P < 0.0001); lipid
      treatment, 58.5% to 63.4% (P < 0.0001); lipid treatment for low-density
      lipoprotein > or =100 mg/dL, 60.4% to 67.0% (P < 0.0001); low-density-lipoprotein
      measurement, 48.8% to 53.2% (P < 0.0001); discharge blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg,
      65.9% to 68.0% (P = 0.03); and referral to cardiac rehabilitation or exercise
      counseling, 65.0% to 88.3% (P < 0.001). Discharge aspirin use at 89.9% did not
      change. Statistically and clinically significant improvement in 10 of 11
      quality-improvement measures for the treatment of patients hospitalized for
      cardiovascular disease was seen in hospitals participating in Get With The
      Guidelines.

TI  - Risk of warfarin-related bleeding events and supratherapeutic international
      normalized ratios associated with complementary and alternative medicine: a
      longitudinal analysis.
PG  - 1237-47
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of bleeding and supratherapeutic
      international normalized ratios (INRs) associated with use of complementary and
      alternative medicine (CAM) in patients receiving warfarin. DESIGN: Prospective,
      longitudinal study. SETTING: An acute care, academic and research hospital in
      Canada. PATIENTS: A total of 171 adults who were prescribed warfarin
      anticoagulation therapy for an expected duration of at least 4 months after
      enrollment. INTERVENTION: Patients were asked to complete a 16-week diary by
      recording bleeding events and exposure to factors previously reported to increase
      the risk of bleeding and supratherapeutic INRs, including CAM consumption.
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Prescription, medical, and laboratory records were
      reviewed. Risk factors for bleeding events and supratherapeutic INR (at least 0.5
      units above the target range) were evaluated longitudinally by using generalized 
      estimating equation (GEE) modeling. Of the 171 patients completing a diary, 87
      (51%) reported at least one bleeding event and 36 (21%) had a supratherapeutic
      INR. Seventy-three patients (43%) indicated they had used at least one CAM
      product previously reported to interact with warfarin. Warfarin use of less than 
      3 months' duration was the only statistically significant risk factor identified 
      for supratherapeutic INR. The CAM therapies associated with an increased risk of 
      self-reported bleeding included cayenne, ginger, willow bark, St. John's wort,
      and coenzyme Q(10). Use of more than one CAM while receiving warfarin was also a 
      significant risk factor. Two CAMs were independently associated with an increased
      risk of self-reported bleeding: coenzyme Q(10) (odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] 1.88-7.24) and ginger (OR 3.20, 95% CI 2.42-4.24). Other
      risk factors significantly associated with increased bleeding included high
      target INR (2.5-3.5), diarrhea, acetaminophen use, increased alcohol consumption,
      and increased age. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CAM by patients receiving warfarin is 
      common, and consumption of coenzyme Q(10) or ginger appears to increase the risk 
      of bleeding in this population.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions for adolescents with a
      substance use disorder.
PG  - 272-81
AB  - Alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drug use among adolescents in the United States
      continues to be a serious public health challenge. A variety of outpatient
      treatments for adolescent substance use disorders have been developed and
      evaluated. Although no specific treatment modality is effective in all settings, 
      a number of promising adolescent interventions have emerged. As policy makers try
      to prioritize which programs to fund with limited public resources, the need for 
      systematic economic evaluations of these programs is critical. The present study 
      attempted a cost-effectiveness analysis of four interventions, including
      family-based, individual, and group cognitive behavioral approaches, for
      adolescents with a substance use disorder. The results indicated that treatment
      costs varied substantially across the four interventions. Moreover, family
      therapy showed significantly better substance use outcome compared to group
      treatment at the 4-month assessment, but group treatment was similar to the other
      interventions for substance use outcome at the 7-month assessment and for
      delinquency outcome at both the 4- and 7-month assessments. These findings over a
      relatively short follow-up period suggest that the least expensive intervention
      (group) was the most cost-effective. However, this study encountered numerous
      data and methodological challenges in trying to supplement a completed clinical
      trial with an economic evaluation. These challenges are explained and
      recommendations are proposed to guide future economic evaluations in this area.

TI  - Prevalence of alcohol abuse and associated factors in a population-based study.
PG  - 502-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence and identify
      associated factors among demographic, family, socioeconomic and mental health
      variables. METHODS: A household survey was carried out in the urban area of
      Campinas, southeastern Brazil, in 2003. A total of 515 subjects, aged 14 years or
      more were randomly selected using a stratified cluster sample. The Self-Report
      Questionnaire and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test were used in the
      interview. Prevalences were calculated, and univariate and multivariate logistic 
      analyses performed by estimating odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
      RESULTS: The estimated prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence was 13.1% (95% CI: 
      8.4;19.9) in men and 4.1% (95% CI: 1.9;8.6) in women. In the final multiple
      logistic regression model, alcohol abuse/dependence was significantly associated 
      with age, income, schooling, religion and illicit drug use. The adjusted odds
      ratios were significantly higher in following variables: income between 2,501 and
      10,000 dollars (OR=10.29); income above 10,000 dollars (OR=10.20); less than 12
      years of schooling (OR=13.42); no religion (OR=9.16) or religion other than
      Evangelical (OR=4.77); and illicit drug use during lifetime (OR=4.47). Alcohol
      abuse and dependence patterns were different according to age group. CONCLUSIONS:
      There is a significantly high prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence in this
      population. The knowledge of factors associated with alcohol abuse, and
      differences in consumption patterns should be taken into account in the
      development of harm reduction strategies.

TI  - Is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder associated with illicit substance use
      disorders in male adolescents? A community-based case-control study.
PG  - 1122-30
AB  - AIMS: This study aims at evaluating the association between
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and illicit substance use
      disorders (SUD) (marijuana, cocaine and inhalants), controlling for the
      association with conduct disorder (CD), in a community-based sample of
      adolescents. DESIGN: Case-control, community-based study. SETTING: A delimited
      geographical area in the South of Brazil, served by four public health clinics.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 968 male adolescents (15-20 years of age) were screened 
      for SUD in their households. Of the subjects who were screened positive, we
      selected 61 cases with illicit SUD. For each case we selected, from the group
      which was screened negative, three controls without illicit or alcohol SUD,
      matched by age and proximity with the case's household. MEASUREMENTS: The
      screening instrument was the Alcohol Smoking and Substance Screening Test
      (ASSIST). SUD diagnoses were assessed by the drug section of the Mini
      International Neuropsychiatry Interview (MINI). Other psychiatric diagnoses were 
      based on semistructured (Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for
      School-Age Children-epidemiological version; MINI) and clinical interviews.
      FINDINGS: Adolescents with ADHD presented a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) 
      for illicit SUD than youths without ADHD, even after adjusting for potential
      confounders (CD, ethnicity, religion and estimated IQ) (OR = 9.12; 95% CI =
      2.84-29.31, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an association between
      ADHD and illicit SUD in Brazilian adolescents that is not mediated by CD. These
      findings are potentially important from a prevention perspective because
      treatments are available for ADHD.

TI  - Statins reduce the risk of lung cancer in humans: a large case-control study of
      US veterans.
PG  - 1282-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins are commonly used cholesterol-lowering agents that are noted 
      to suppress tumor cell growth in several in vitro and animal models. METHODS: We 
      studied the association of lung cancer and the use of statins in patients
      enrolled in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. A retrospective
      case-control study nested in a cohort study was conducted using prospectively
      collected data from the Veterans Integrated Service Networks 16 VA database from 
      1998 to 2004. We analyzed data on 483,733 patients from eight states located in
      south central United States. The primary variables of interest were lung cancer
      and the use of statins prior to the diagnosis of lung cancer. Multiple logistic
      regression analysis was done to adjust for covariates including age, sex, body
      mass index, smoking, diabetes, and race. Statistical software was used for
      statistical computing. RESULTS: Of the 483,733 patients in the study, 163,662
      patients (33.8%) were receiving statins and 7,280 patients (1.5%) had a primary
      diagnosis of lung cancer. Statin use > 6 months was associated with a risk
      reduction of lung cancer of 55% (adjusted odds ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence
      interval, 0.42 to 0.48; p < 0.01). Furthermore, the protective effect of statin
      was seen across different age and racial groups and was irrespective of the
      presence of diabetes, smoking, or alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Statins appear to be 
      protective against the development of lung cancer, and further studies need to be
      done to define the clinical utility of statins as chemo protective agents.

TI  - Evaluation of the incidence of preterm low birth weight in patients undergoing
      periodontal therapy.
PG  - 842-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm low birth weight was reported to be related to periodontal
      infections that might influence the fetus-placenta complex. The aim of this study
      was to provide periodontal treatment for pregnant women and to evaluate if this
      treatment can interfere with pregnancy duration and weight of the newborn.
      METHODS: The sample consisted of 450 pregnant women who were under prenatal care 
      at a polyclinic in Tres Coracoes, Brazil. Women with risk factors, such as
      systemic alterations (ischemic cardiopathy, hypertension, tuberculosis, diabetes,
      cancer, anemia, seizure, psychopathology, urinary tract infection, sexually
      transmitted diseases, asthma, and human immunodeficiency virus), and/or users of 
      alcohol, tobacco, and drugs were excluded from the study. Data related to age,
      socioeconomic level, race, marital status, number of previous pregnancies, and
      previous preterm delivery also were evaluated. Initially, the sample was divided 
      into two groups: 122 healthy patients (group 1) and 328 patients with periodontal
      disease (group 2). In group 2, 266 patients underwent treatment and 62 patients
      dropped out. After mothers gave birth, pregnancy duration and the weight of all
      infants were analyzed and recorded. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference 
      between the healthy and treated groups. However, there was a difference in the
      non-treated group, with a 79% incidence of preterm low birth weight. Educational 
      level, previous preterm birth, and periodontal disease were related significantly
      to preterm delivery (P <0.001). CONCLUSION: Periodontal disease was related
      significantly to preterm low birth weight.

TI  - Symptom management and self-care for peripheral neuropathy in HIV/AIDS.
PG  - 179-89
AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication in HIV and is 
      often associated with antiretroviral therapy. As part of a larger study on
      self-care for symptoms in HIV disease, this study analyzed the prevalence and
      characteristics of peripheral neuropathy in HIV disease, sociodemographic and
      disease-related correlates and self-care strategies. A convenience sample of
      1,217 respondents was recruited from data collection sites in several US cities, 
      Puerto Rico, Colombia and Taiwan. Results of the study indicated that respondents
      with peripheral neuropathy (n=450) identified 20 self-care behaviors including
      complementary therapies, use of medications, exercise and rest and/or elevation
      of extremities. Ratings of frequency and effectiveness were also included. An
      activities checklist summarized into five categories of self-care behaviors
      including activities/thoughts, exercise, medications, complementary therapies and
      substance was used to determine self-care behaviors. Taking a hot bath was the
      most frequent strategy used by those with peripheral neuropathy (n=292) and
      received the highest overall rating of effectiveness of any self-management
      strategies included in this study at 8.1 (scale 1-10). Other self-care strategies
      to manage this symptom included: staying off the feet (n=258), rubbing the feet
      with cream (n=177), elevating the feet (n=236), walking (n=262), prescribed
      anti-epileptic agent (n=80), prescribed analgesics (n=84), over-the-counter
      medications (n=123), vitamin B (n=122), calcium supplements (n=72), magnesium
      (n=48), massage (n=156), acupuncture (n=43), reflexology (n=23) and meditation
      (n=80). Several behaviors that are often deemed unhealthy were included among the
      strategies reported to alleviate peripheral neuropathy including use of marijuana
      (n=67), cigarette smoking (n=139), drinking alcohol (n=81) and street drugs
      (n=30).

TI  - An evaluation of patient preference for an alternative insulin delivery system
      compared to standard vial and syringe.
PG  - 133-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) affects over 18.2 million Americans and
      diabetes-related medical costs exceed 132 billion dollars per year, totaling more
      than 12% of the United States healthcare budget. The Diabetes Control and
      Complications Clinical Trial demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy and the 
      control of plasma glucose can significantly reduce the incidence of late diabetic
      complications and delay the progression of existing conditions in type 1
      diabetes. Optimal glycemic control often requires intensive insulin therapy to
      maintain a hemoglobin A(1C) (A1C) of less than 7% as recommended by the American 
      Diabetes Association. It is estimated that more than half of the approximately 7 
      million Americans using insulin do so with suboptimal treatment and while
      administering one or two insulin injections per day. Non-adherence may be a
      contributing factor in suboptimal treatment. For a variety of reasons, many
      patients diagnosed with diabetes and treated with insulin are non-adherent.
      SCOPE: The primary objective of this study was to evaluate preference for an
      insulin delivery system comparing a disposable doser (InnoLet) to the standard
      vial/syringe. In a prospective, randomized, open-label, two-period, crossover
      study, 260 patients were enrolled (age > or = 18 years, with type 1 or 2
      diabetes, and receiving NPH or regular or 70/30 insulin for at least 6-months). A
      total of 162 patients completed both treatment arms. Excluded were those unable
      to read/write English or administer their own injections, pregnant/lactating
      women, those using antipsychotics, and those with a history of alcohol abuse or
      cognitive impairment. Patients completed the eight-item Diabetes Fear of
      Self-Injection Questionnaire at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Items were rated
      on a 4-point Likert scale (1 = almost never; 4 = almost always) with a maximum
      fear score of 32. At week 24, patients completed a preference survey. FINDINGS:
      Of the 162 patients completing both treatment arms, 89 (55.0%) were in the
      vial/syringe to disposable doser treatment arm, 50% were female and mean age was 
      60 +/- 11 years. Patients in both treatment arms displayed little significant
      differences in baseline characteristics. Patients reported significantly lower
      fear of self-injection after using the disposable doser compared to vial/syringe 
      (mean +/- SEM: 9.5 +/- 0.2 vs. 11.2 +/- 0.4; p < 0.0001). Most patients (71.5%)
      indicated a preference for the disposable doser compared to the vial/syringe
      method (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: The majority of patients preferred the
      disposable doser, and reported significantly less fear of self-injection using
      this delivery system. There are some potential limitations to consider. A
      randomization bias may have been present, patients who enrolled in this study
      were those who were actively seeking medical treatment for diabetes, insulin pens
      and cartridges are not available for all types of insulin regimens, pre-filled
      pens and cartridges may not be altered and, in general, alternative insulin
      delivery systems tend to be more costly than insulin sold in traditional vials.
      However, insulin may have greater patient acceptance and less psychological
      distress when administered via an alternative delivery system.

TI  - Preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancies: a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth
      defects and developmental disabilities in the United States. DESIGN: A randomized
      controlled trial (2002-2005; data analyzed 2005-2006) of a brief motivational
      intervention to reduce the risk of an alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in
      preconceptional women by focusing on both risk drinking and ineffective
      contraception use. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 830 nonpregnant women, aged
      18-44 years, and currently at risk for an AEP were recruited in six diverse
      settings in Florida, Texas, and Virginia. Combined settings had higher
      proportions of women at risk for AEP (12.5% overall) than in the general
      population (2%). INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive
      information plus a brief motivational intervention (n=416) or to receive
      information only (n=414). The brief motivational intervention consisted of four
      counseling sessions and one contraception consultation and services visit. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Women consuming more than five drinks on any day or more than
      eight drinks per week on average, were considered risk drinkers; women who had
      intercourse without effective contraception were considered at risk of pregnancy.
      Reversing either or both risk conditions resulted in reduced risk of an AEP.
      RESULTS: Across the follow-up period, the odds ratios (ORs) of being at reduced
      risk for AEP were twofold greater in the intervention group: 3 months, 2.31 (95% 
      confidence interval [CI]=1.69-3.20); 6 months, 2.15 (CI=1.52-3.06); 9 months,
      2.11 (CI=1.47-3.03). Between-groups differences by time phase were 18.0%, 17.0%, 
      and 14. 8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A brief motivational intervention can
      reduce the risk of an AEP.

TI  - Multidetector computed tomography for coronary artery disease screening in
      asymptomatic populations: evidence-based analysis.
PG  - 1-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This evidence-based health technology assessment systematically
      reviewed the published literature on multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)
      angiography (with contrast) as a diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease
      (CAD), and applied the results of the assessment to health care practices in
      Ontario. CLINICAL NEED: Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in 
      the western world. Occlusion of coronary arteries reduces coronary blood flow and
      oxygen delivery to the myocardium (heart muscle). The rupture of an unstable
      atherosclerotic plaque may result in myocardial infarction. If left untreated,
      CAD can result in heart failure and, subsequently, death. According to the Heart 
      and Stroke Foundation of Canada, 54% of all cardiovascular deaths are due to CAD.
      Patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, and genetics), underlying clinical
      conditions that predispose to cardiac conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension,
      and elevated cholesterol), lifestyle characteristics, (e.g., obesity, smoking,
      and physical inactivity), and, more recently, determinants of health (e.g.,
      socioeconomic status) may predict the risk of getting CAD. In 2004/2005, The
      Ontario government funded approximately 15,400 percutaneous (through the skin)
      coronary interventions and 7,840 coronary bypass procedures for the treatment of 
      CAD. These numbers are expected to reach 22,355 for percutaneous coronary
      interventions and 12,323 for coronary bypass procedures in 2006/2007. It was
      noted that more than one-half of all first coronary events occur in people
      without symptoms of CAD. In Ontario in 2000/2001, $457.9 million (Cdn) was spent 
      on invasive ($237.4 million) and noninvasive ($220.5 million) cardiac services.
      The use of noninvasive cardiac tests, in particular, is rising rapidly. THE
      TECHNOLOGY: Computed tomography (CT) is a medical imaging method employing
      tomography where digital geometry processing is used to generate a 3-dimensional 
      image of the internals of an object from a large series of 2-dimensional X-ray
      images taken around a single axis of rotation. Multidetector computed tomography 
      is performed for noninvasive imaging of the coronary arteries. Computer software 
      quantifies the amount of calcium within the coronary arteries and calculates a
      coronary artery calcium score. Compared with conventional CT scanning, MDCT can
      provide smaller pieces of information and cover a larger area faster. Advanced
      MDCT technology (that is, 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-slice systems) can produce more
      images in less time. For general CT scanning, this faster capability can reduce
      the length of time people are required to be still during the procedure and
      thereby reduce potential movement artifact. However, the additional clinical
      utility of images obtained from faster scanners compared with the images obtained
      from conventional CT scanners for current CT indications (i.e., nonmoving body
      parts) is unknown. REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory Secretariat completed a 
      computer-aided search limited to English-language studies in humans from 1998 to 
      2007 in multiple medical literature databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The
      Cochrane Library, and INAHTA/CRD. Case reports, letters, editorials,
      nonsystematic reviews, and comments were excluded. Additional studies that met
      the inclusion and exclusion criteria were obtained from reference lists of
      included studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to the results
      according to the criteria listed below. The Grading of Recommendations
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the
      overall quality of the body of evidence (defined as 1 or more studies) supporting
      the research questions explored in this systematic review. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
      AND CONCLUSIONS: Screening the asymptomatic population for CAD using MDCT does
      not meet World Health Organization criteria for screening; hence, it is not
      justifiable. Coronary artery calcification measured by MDCT is a good predictor
      of future cardiovascular events. However, MDCT exhibits only moderately high
      sensitivity and specificity for detection of CAD in an asymptomatic population.
      If population-based screening were implemented, a high rate of false positives
      would result in increased downstream costs and interventions. Additionally, some 
      cases of CAD would be missed, as they may not be developed, or not yet have
      progressed to detectable levels. There is no evidence for the impact of screening
      on patient management. Cardiovascular risk factors are positively associated with
      the presence of coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular events; however,
      risk factor stratification to identify high-risk asymptomatic individuals is
      unclear given the current evidence-base. Safety of MDCT screening is also an
      issue because of the introduction of increased radiation doses for the initial
      screening scan and possible follow-up interventions. No large randomized
      controlled trials of MDCT screening have been published, which indicates an
      important area of future research. Lastly, the policy implications for MDCT
      screening for CAD in the asymptomatic population are significant. There is no
      evidence on the long-term implications of screening, and the potential impact on 
      the resources of the health care system is considerable.

TI  - Concurrent validity of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and 
      AUDIT zones in defining levels of severity among out-patients with alcohol
      dependence in the COMBINE study.
PG  - 1696-704
AB  - AIMS: To examine among alcohol-dependent out-patient clients the concurrent
      validity of the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) total score and
      'zones' suggested by the World Health Organization for defining levels of
      severity of alcohol use problems. DESIGN: Participants were classified into AUDIT
      zones (AUDIT total score = 8-15, 16-19, 20-40) and compared on measures of
      demographics, treatment goals, alcohol consumption, alcohol-related consequences,
      severity of dependence, physiological dependence, tolerance, withdrawal and
      biomarkers of alcohol use. SETTING: Eleven out-patient academic clinical research
      centers across the United States. Participants Alcohol dependent individuals (n =
      1335) entering out-patient treatment in the Combined Pharmacotherapies and
      Behavioral Interventions (COMBINE) study. MEASUREMENTS: The AUDIT was
      administered as part of an initial screening. Baseline measures used for
      concurrent validation included the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic
      and Statistical Manual, 4th edition (DSM-IV) Disorders, the Alcohol Dependence
      Scale, the Drinker Inventory of Consequences, the Obsessive-Compulsive Drinking
      Scale, the University of Rhode Island Change Assessment, the Thoughts about
      Abstinence Scale, the Form-90, %carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and
      gamma-glutamyl transferase. Findings Indicators of severity of dependence and
      alcohol-related problems increased linearly with total score and differed
      significantly across AUDIT zones. The highest zone, with scores of 20 and above, 
      was markedly different with respect to severity from the other two zones and
      members of this group endorsed an abstinence goal more strongly. CONCLUSIONS: The
      AUDIT total score is a brief measure that appears to provide an index of severity
      of dependence in a sample of alcohol-dependent individuals seeking out-patient
      treatment, extending its potential utility beyond its more traditional role as a 
      screening instrument in general populations.

TI  - Initial steps taken by nine primary care practices to implement alcohol screening
      guidelines with hypertensive patients: the AA-TRIP project.
PG  - 61-70
AB  - Many medical conditions are caused or exacerbated by heavy drinking,
      necessitating alcohol screening and discussion in primary care practices. This is
      particularly true of hypertension, the most common primary diagnosis in the
      United States, which has been linked to the regular consumption of 3 or more
      standard alcoholic beverages a day. The Accelerating Alcohol
      Screening-Translating Research into Practice (AA-TRIP) project was designed to
      improve detection and management of alcohol problems in primary care patients
      with hypertension. Medical providers are being trained using the Practice Partner
      Research Network's- Translating Research into Practice (PPRNet-TRIP) quality
      improvement model. This includes a multi-method intervention (electronic medical 
      records, on-site academic detailing, practice feedback reports and annual network
      meetings) to help practices increase adherence to clinical guidelines.
      Qualitative analyses of initial steps taken by nine primary care practices toward
      the routine implementation of alcohol screening guidelines are presented.
      Organizational factors and provider and patient characteristics all influenced
      the method and consistency of alcohol screening and intervention. Perceived time 
      constraints, patient sensitivity to questions about alcohol, and possible stigma 
      associated with a diagnosis of alcoholism were also relevant barriers requiring
      problem solving.

TI  - Evidence for smoking cessation: Implications for gender-specific strategies.
PG  - 63-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: Facilitating smoking cessation requires an evidence-based approach.
      The Lienhard School of Nursing Institute for Healthy Aging in the United States, 
      whose focus is providing health information to aging baby boomers, developed an
      interest in studying strategies for smoking cessation in women. APPROACH: Studies
      were reviewed and critiqued related to the question: What is the relative
      efficacy of first-line smoking cessation interventions for women versus men in
      the 40- to 65-year-old age group? This article first discusses the procedure used
      to construct an integrative framework for finding the evidence on smoking
      cessation, including a literature search and refinement of the problem to be
      studied, and then a summary of the evidence gathered on the selected variable
      (gender) and interventions (counseling, pharmacotherapy, nicotine replacement
      therapy). FINDINGS: Evidence was found that supports the general efficacy of
      three first-line smoking cessation interventions: counseling, bupropion-sustained
      release (BSR), and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). What the evidence does not
      show, however, is which of these interventions may be more effective for women
      versus men in general or specifically in the 40- to 65-year-old age group.
      RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations include the development of a clinical trial and 
      the inclusion from the outset of gender as a major variable in all future
      intervention studies. IMPLICATIONS: Practice implications include the fact that
      since effective treatments already exist for assisting clients to stop smoking,
      all health-care providers should offer an intervention that has been found
      effective to any client who expresses a desire to quit smoking. Further studies
      of efficacy are needed to develop more focused implications.

TI  - Brief interventions for high-risk drinkers.
PG  - 1383-96
AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this paper is to explore the literature on
      brief alcohol intervention and to review the literature that examines the status 
      of the clinic nurse in the delivery of these interventions. The objective is to
      review critically the literature on brief intervention to create links for nurse 
      developed and delivered brief intervention to high-risk drinkers. BACKGROUND:
      Population estimates suggest that more than one-third of North Americans drink
      excessively with even higher rates for individuals treated in primary care
      settings. Alcohol use has been identified as the third leading cause of mortality
      in the United States. This problem is not unique to the US and, worldwide,
      agencies and governmental offices and ministries have issued recommendations to
      screen patients for alcohol misuse and deliver brief interventions to individuals
      considered to be high-risk drinkers. Numerous randomized controlled trials and
      recent meta-analyses have supported the use of screening and brief intervention
      for reducing alcohol consumption in primary healthcare settings. The vast
      majority of studies reporting on brief interventions have focused on the role of 
      the physician with minimal if any involvement of the clinic nurse. A scant number
      of studies have been conducted that define and assess the role or potential role 
      of the clinic nurse in providing screening and brief intervention to high-risk
      drinkers in the primary care setting. METHODS: Systematic review. RESULTS: Six
      systematic reviews and meta-analyses from an international base of studies
      support the use of brief intervention in the primary care setting. Three
      randomized control trials have highlighted the role of the staff or clinic nurse 
      but there are no meta-analyses addressing nurse-delivered brief interventions.
      Numerous studies have explored factors effecting the implementation of brief
      intervention into the primary care setting. CONCLUSION: Brief intervention is
      recognized as a legitimate nursing role but little has been done to develop and
      define the role of the nurse in delivering brief interventions to high-risk
      drinkers. This represents a major lacuna in both the nursing and alcoholism
      literature, where only a handful of studies have investigated nurse-delivered
      brief intervention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As health screening and
      health promotion are hallmarks of nursing care, nurses need to explore the use of
      brief intervention in their daily practice.

TI  - Implementation of evidence-based alcohol screening in the Veterans Health
      Administration.
PG  - 597-606
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite evidence-based guidelines, brief alcohol screening and
      counseling have not been routinely integrated into most primary care practices in
      the United States. OBJECTIVE: To describe the results of the implementation of
      evidence-based alcohol screening by the Veterans Health Administration (VA) in
      2004, as the first step toward implementation of brief alcohol counseling. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This observational study of outpatients from all 21 VA networks relied on
      the following 2 data sources from the VA Office of Quality and Performance: (1)
      Medical record reviews, designed to compare VA networks quarterly, evaluated
      whether established VA patients had documented screening for alcohol misuse and
      documented follow-up assessment for alcohol use disorders among those who
      screened positive for alcohol misuse (January-March 2005); and (2) Mailed patient
      satisfaction surveys from 2004, which oversampled patients new to the VA
      (response rate, >70%), included the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
      Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) questions and asked about past-year advice "to drink
      less or not to drink alcohol" from a VA provider. RESULTS: Based on 10 115
      medical record reviews, 93% (range, 89%-96% across networks) of outpatients were 
      screened for alcohol misuse, and 25% (range, 11%-36%) screened positive. Among
      screen-positive patients, 42% (range, 5%-84%) had documented follow-up
      assessment, but absolute numbers of screen-positive patients evaluated were small
      (27-80 patients per network). Based on 235 481 patient surveys, the prevalence of
      alcohol misuse was 22% (range, 15%-27% across networks), and 28% (range, 20%-
      36%) of screen-positive patients reported receiving alcohol-related advice.
      Alcohol-related advice increased as AUDIT-C scores increased. CONCLUSION: The VA 
      successfully implemented evidence-based alcohol screening, but the rate of
      follow-up among screen-positive patients remained low.

TI  - Effectiveness of brief interventions after alcohol-related vehicular injury: A
      randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 523-31; discussion 532-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because 40% of motor vehicle fatalities in the United States are
      alcohol-related, interventions delivered by trauma clinicians targeted to reduce 
      drinking are of particular importance to public health. The objective of this
      study was to test the effectiveness of hospital-based brief intervention
      strategies to reduce alcohol consumption and other health-related outcomes in the
      year after an alcohol-related vehicular injury. Brief interventions are
      clinically based strategies including assessment and direct feedback about
      drinking alcohol, goal setting, behavioral modification techniques, and the use
      of a self-help manual. METHODS: The study was a randomized controlled trial of
      two types of brief intervention with a 12-month follow-up. Participants with
      alcohol-related vehicular injury who were admitted to Level I trauma centers were
      eligible for enrollment. Enrolled participants were randomized to a control,
      simple advice, or brief counseling condition. Primary outcome variables were
      alcohol consumption (standard drinks/month, binges/month), adverse driving events
      (driving citations, traffic crashes), and changes in health status (hospital and 
      emergency department admissions). RESULTS: The study enrolled 187 participants at
      baseline and retained 100 across 12 months. Participants had a significant
      decrease in alcohol consumption and traffic citations at 12 months as compared
      with baseline. Mean standard drinks/month declined from 56.80 (SD 63.89) at
      baseline to 32.10 (SD 53.20) at 12 months. Mean binges/month declined from 5.79
      (SD 6.98) at baseline to 3.21 (SD 6.17) at 12 months. There were no differences
      in alcohol consumption, adverse driving events, or health status by condition.
      CONCLUSIONS: Whether the reductions in alcohol consumption and traffic citations 
      were a result of the crash, hospitalization for injury, screening for alcohol
      use, or combination of these factors is difficult to determine. Further work is
      needed to understand the mechanisms involved in reductions of health-related
      outcomes and the role of brief intervention in this population.

TI  - Psychotherapeutic interventions for cannabis abuse and/or dependence in
      outpatient settings.
PG  - CD005336
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis use disorder is the most common illicit substance use
      disorder in general population. Despite that, only a minority seek assistance
      from a health professional, but the demand for treatment is now increasing
      internationally. Trials of treatment have been published but to our knowledge,
      there is no published systematic review . OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of
      psychosocial interventions for cannabis abuse or dependence. SEARCH STRATEGY: We 
      searched the Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL) The Cochrane Library
      Issue 3, 2004; MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2004), PsycInfo (1985 to October
      2004), CINAHL (1982 to October 2004), Toxibase (until September 2004) and
      reference lists of articles. We also contacted researchers in the field.
      SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled studies examining a
      psychotherapeutic intervention for cannabis dependence or abuse in comparison
      with a delayed-treatment control group or combinations of psychotherapeutic
      interventions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed
      trial quality and extracted data MAIN RESULTS: Six trials involving 1297 people
      were included. Five studies took place in the United States, one in Australia.
      Studies were not pooled in meta-analysis because of heterogeneity. The six
      included studies suggested that counseling approaches might have beneficial
      effects for the treatment of cannabis dependence. Group and individual sessions
      of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) had both efficacy for the treatment of
      cannabis dependence and associated problems, CBT produced better outcomes than a 
      brief intervention when CBT was delivered in individual sessions. Two studies
      suggested that adding voucher-based incentives may enhance treatment when used in
      combination with other effective psychotherapeutic interventions. Abstinence
      rates were relatively small overall but favored the individual CBT 9-session (or 
      more) condition. All included trials reported a statistically significant
      reductions in frequency of cannabis use and dependence symptoms. But other
      measures of problems related to cannabis use were not consistently different.
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The included studies were too heterogenous and could not
      allow to draw up a clear conclusion. The studies comparing different therapeutic 
      modalities raise important questions about the duration, intensity and type of
      treatment. The generalizability of findings is also unknown because the studies
      have been conducted in a limited number of localities with fairly homogenous
      samples of treatment seekers. However, the low abstinence rate indicated that
      cannabis dependence is not easily treated by psychotherapies in outpatient
      settings.

TI  - Improving preventive service delivery at adult complete health check-ups: the
      Preventive health Evidence-based Recommendation Form (PERFORM) cluster randomized
      controlled trial.
PG  - 44
AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine the effectiveness of a single checklist reminder form to
      improve the delivery of preventive health services at adult health check-ups in a
      family practice setting. METHODS: A prospective cluster randomized controlled
      trial was conducted at four urban family practice clinics among 38 primary care
      physicians affiliated with the University of Toronto. Preventive Care Checklist
      Forms were created to be used by family physicians at adult health check-ups over
      a five-month period. The sex-specific forms incorporate evidence-based
      recommendations on preventive health services and documentation space for routine
      procedures such as physical examination. The forms were used in two intervention 
      clinics and two control clinics. Rates and relative risks (RR) of the performance
      of 13 preventive health maneuvers at baseline and post-intervention and the
      percentage of up-to-date preventive health services delivered per patient were
      compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Randomly-selected charts were reviewed 
      at baseline (n = 509) and post-intervention (n = 608). Baseline rates for
      provision of preventive health services ranged from 3% (fecal occult blood
      testing) to 93% (blood pressure measurement), similar to other settings. The
      percentage of up-to-date preventive health services delivered per patient at the 
      end of the intervention was 48.9% in the control group and 71.7% in the
      intervention group. This is an overall 22.8% absolute increase (p = 0.0001), and 
      46.6% relative increase in the delivery of preventive health services per patient
      in the intervention group compared to controls. Eight of thirteen preventive
      health services showed a statistically significant change (p < 0.05) in favor of 
      the intervention (adjusted RR (95% C.I.)): counseling on brushing/flossing teeth 
      (9.2 (4.3-19.6)), folic acid counseling (7.5 (2.7-20.8)), fecal occult blood
      testing (6.7 (1.9-24.1)), smoking cessation counseling (3.9 (2.2-7.2)), tetanus
      immunization (3.0 (1.7-5.2)), history of alcohol intake (1.33 (1.2-1.5)), history
      of smoking habits (1.28 (1.2-1.4)) and blood pressure measurement (1.05
      (1.00-1.10)). CONCLUSION: This simple, low cost, clinically relevant intervention
      improves the delivery of preventive health services by prompting physicians of
      evidence-based recommendations in a checklist format that incorporates existing
      practice patterns. Periodic updates of the Preventive Care Checklist Forms will
      allow a feasible and easy-to-use tool for primary care physicians to provide
      evidence-based preventive health services to adults at routine health check-ups. 
      The forms can also be incorporated into an electronic health record. The
      Preventive Care Checklist Forms are accessible in English and French at the
      College of Family Physicians of Canada web site.

PG  - 4-15
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic
      characteristics, patient perceptions, and patient characteristics including
      spirituality, self-reported adherence, and highly active antiretroviral therapy. 
      The convenience sample consisted of 120 English-speaking adults (60% male, 35%
      female, 5% transgendered) with HIV/AIDS from two HIV service agencies in a large 
      metropolitan city in the southeastern United States. The mean self-reported
      adherence was 83.1% (SD = 15.7%). Adherence was significantly correlated with
      perceived support and absence of barriers, strong intentions to adhere, perceived
      effectiveness of the medications, higher levels of perceived general health,
      fewer years of HIV disease, and fewer years on antiretroviral medications.
      Existential well-being (e.g., viewing life as positive and having meaning) was a 
      weak significant correlate. Backward regression analysis was conducted to
      identify a parsimonious model of predictors of adherence. The final model
      included presence of support and absence of barriers, fewer years of HIV
      infection, no current alcohol use, perceived severity of HIV, existential
      well-being, and male gender. This model explained 19.4% of the variance in
      adherence (observed F[6, 100] = 5.6, p < .0001).

TI  - Socioeconomic variations in nicotine dependence, self-efficacy, and intention to 
      quit across four countries: findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC)
      Four Country Survey.
PG  - iii71-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on nicotine
      dependence, self-efficacy, and intention to quit. DESIGN SETTING AND
      PARTICIPANTS: Data were from the first wave (2002) of the International Tobacco
      Control (ITC) Four Country Survey (ITC-4), a panel study of over 2000 adult
      smokers from each of four countries: the United States, Canada, the United
      Kingdom, and Australia. Data were collected via telephone interviews. MAIN
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Nicotine dependence, intention to quit, and self-efficacy to
      quit smoking were the main outcome measures used in this study. RESULTS: Lower
      levels of education were associated with higher nicotine dependence. The effect
      of lower income on higher heaviness of smoking index (HIS) scores was significant
      in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Respondents with low education had 35% larger
      odds of low self-efficacy than those with high education. Respondents with low
      education had 40% larger odds of having no intention to quit than those with high
      education. Respondents with low income had 23% larger odds of having no intention
      to quit than those with high income. Country was not a moderator of the
      association of SES with self-efficacy and intention to quit. CONCLUSION: To the
      extent that lower SES smokers are more addicted, they are likely to need more
      intensive support if they are to be successful in their attempts to quit. Given
      their lower incomes, this places a special responsibility on government to
      provide or subsidise such services. This should include access to the widest
      possible range of effective pharmacotherapies complemented with evidence based
      counselling and support.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapies for nicotine dependence in primary care
      settings: a multinational comparison.
PG  - 152-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the first-line
      pharmacotherapies (nicotine gum, patch, spray, inhaler, and bupropion) for
      smoking cessation across six Western countries-Canada, France, Spain,
      Switzerland, the United States, and the United Kingdom. DESIGN AND STUDY
      POPULATION: A Markov-chain cohort model to simulate two cohorts of smokers: (1) a
      reference cohort given brief cessation counselling by a general practitioner
      (GP); (2) a treatment cohort given counselling plus pharmacotherapy.
      Effectiveness expressed as odds ratios for quitting associated with
      pharmacotherapies. Costs based on the additional physician time required and
      retail prices of the medications. INTERVENTIONS: Addition of each first-line
      pharmacotherapy to GP cessation counselling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per
      life-year saved associated with pharmacotherapies. RESULTS: The cost per
      life-year saved for counselling only ranged from US190 dollars in Spain to 773
      dollars in the UK for men, and from 288 dollars in Spain to 1168 dollars in the
      UK for women. The incremental cost per life-year saved for gum ranged from 2230
      dollars for men in Spain to 7643 dollars for women in the US; for patch from 1758
      dollars for men in Spain to 5131 dollars for women in the UK; for spray from 1935
      dollars for men in Spain to 7969 dollars for women in the US; for inhaler from
      3480 dollars for men in Switzerland to 8700 dollars for women in France; and for 
      bupropion from 792 dollars for men in Canada to 2922 dollars for women in the US.
      In sensitivity analysis, changes in discount rate, treatment effectiveness, and
      natural quit rate had the strongest influences on cost-effectiveness.
      CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of the pharmacotherapies varied significantly
      across the six study countries, however, in each case, the results would be
      considered favourable as compared to other common preventive pharmacotherapies.

TI  - Tobacco use by adolescents: the role of the oral health professional in
      evidence-based cessation programs.
PG  - 177-87; discussion 192-8
AB  - The use of tobacco products, especially cigarette smoking, represents the leading
      cause of preventable illness and death in the developed world. In the United
      States, major gains have been made to reduce smoking among adults. Similar gains,
      however, have not been realized with adolescents. In recent years, substantial
      interest has been directed to tobacco cessation studies with adolescents. The
      previously limited interest in adolescent cessation programs was attributable in 
      large part to the mistaken assumptions that: (1) adolescent tobacco users were
      not dependent on nicotine and could stop at any time; (2) adolescents did not
      want to quit; and (3) adult tobacco cessation programs would be effective with
      adolescents. The need for programs to increase adolescent cessation attempts is
      underscored by the Healthy People 2010 goal that calls for an increase in tobacco
      use cessation attempts by adolescent smokers to 84%. Dental providers need to
      take steps to prevent tobacco use by adolescent patients. For those who are
      already addicted, they need to provide cessation counseling services or referral 
      for appropriate treatment. The purpose of this paper was to provide dental
      clinicians with information on: (1) tobacco and health; (2) the epidemiology of
      adolescent tobacco use; and (3) tobacco cessation programs for parents and
      adolescents that can be implemented in the dental office setting.

TI  - Does random urine drug testing reduce illicit drug use in chronic pain patients
      receiving opioids?
PG  - 123-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prescription drug abuse and illicit drug use are common in chronic
      pain patients. Adherence monitoring with screening tests, and urine drug testing,
      periodic monitoring with prescription monitoring programs, has become a common
      practice in recent years. Random drug testing for appropriate use of opioids and 
      use of illicit drugs is often used in pain management practices. Thus, it is
      expected that random urine drug testing will deter use of illicit drugs, and also
      improve compliance. OBJECTIVES: To study the prevalence of illicit drug use in
      patients receiving opioids for chronic pain management and to compare the results
      of illicit drug use with the results from a previous study. DESIGN: A
      prospective, consecutive study. SETTING: Interventional pain management practice 
      setting in the United States. METHODS: A total of 500 consecutive patients on
      opioids, considered to be receiving stable doses of opioids supplemental to their
      interventional techniques, were studied by random drug testing. Testing was
      performed by rapid drug screen. Results were considered positive if one or more
      of the monitored illicit drugs including cocaine, marijuana (THC),
      methamphetamine or amphetamines were present. RESULTS: Illicit drug use was
      evident in 80 patients, or 16%, with marijuana in 11%, cocaine in 5%, and
      methamphetamine and/or amphetamines in 2%. When compared with previous data, the 
      overall illicit drug use was significantly less. Illicit drug use in elderly
      patients was absent. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of illicit drug abuse in patients
      with chronic pain receiving opioids continues to be a common occurence. This
      study showed significant reductions in overall illicit drug use with adherence
      monitoring combined with random urine drug testing.

TI  - The effects of nicotine gum and counseling among African American light smokers: 
      a 2 x 2 factorial design.
PG  - 883-91
AB  - AIM: Approximately 50% of African American smokers are light smokers (smoke < or 
      = 10 cigarettes a day). The prevalence of light smoking in the United States is
      increasing, yet there has not been a single smoking cessation clinical trial
      targeting light smokers. The purpose of this 2 x 2 factorial, randomized clinical
      trial was to evaluate the efficacy of nicotine gum (2 mg versus placebo) and
      counseling (motivational interviewing versus health education) for African
      American light smokers. DESIGN: Participants were assigned randomly to one of
      four study arms: 2 mg nicotine gum plus health education (HE); 2 mg nicotine gum 
      plus motivational interviewing (MI); placebo gum plus HE; and placebo gum plus
      MI. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: A total of 755 African American light smokers (66% 
      female, mean age = 45) were enrolled at a community health center over a 16-month
      period. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Participants received an 8-week supply of 
      nicotine gum and six counseling sessions during the course of the 26-week study. 
      Biochemical measures included expired carbon monoxide (CO) and serum and salivary
      cotinine. FINDINGS: Seven-day quit rates for nicotine gum were no better than for
      the placebo group (14.2% versus 11.1%, P = 0.232) at 6 months. However, a
      counseling effect emerged, with HE performing significantly better than MI (16.7%
      versus 8.5%, P < 0.001). These results were consistent across outcome time-points
      (weeks 1, 8, and 26). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the potential positive
      impact of directive information and advice-oriented counseling on smoking
      cessation. Studies are needed to assess other interventions that may further
      improve quit rates among African American light smokers who are motivated to
      quit.

TI  - Celebremos la salud! a community randomized trial of cancer prevention (United
      States).
PG  - 733-46
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics in the United States are
      at higher risk for certain types of cancer. METHODS: In a randomized controlled
      trial of 20 communities, we examined whether a comprehensive intervention
      influenced cancer screening behaviors and lifestyle practices in rural
      communities in Eastern Washington State. Cross-sectional surveys at baseline and 
      post-intervention included interviews with a random sample of approximately 100
      households per community. The interview included questions on ever use and recent
      use of Pap test, mammogram, and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and
      sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy, fruit and vegetable consumption and smoking practices.
      RESULTS: We found few significant changes in use of screening services for
      cervical (Pap test), breast (mammogram) or colorectal cancer (fecal occult blood 
      test (FOBT) or sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy) between intervention and control
      communities. We found no significant differences in fruit and vegetable
      consumption nor in smoking prevalence between the two groups. We found more
      awareness of and participation in intervention activities in the treatment
      communities than the control communities. CONCLUSIONS: Our null findings might be
      attributable to the low dose of the intervention, a cohort effect, or
      contamination of the effect in non-intervention communities. Further research to 
      identify effective strategies to improve cancer prevention lifestyle behaviors
      and screening practices are needed.

      filtration rate, and hematocrit with 25-year incidence of end-stage renal disease
      in the multiple risk factor intervention trial.
PG  - 1444-52
AB  - The incidence of ESRD is increasing rapidly. Limited information exists regarding
      early markers for the development of ESRD. This study aimed to determine over 25 
      yr the risk for ESRD associated with proteinuria, estimated GFR (eGFR), and
      hematocrit in men who did not have identified kidney disease and were randomly
      assigned into the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Study (MRFIT). A total of
      12,866 men who were at high risk for heart disease were enrolled (1973 to 1975)
      and followed through 1999. Renal replacement therapy was ascertained by matching 
      identifiers with the United States Renal Data System's data; vital status was
      from the National Death Index. Men who initiated renal replacement therapy or
      died as a result of kidney disease were deemed to have developed ESRD. Dipstick
      urine for proteinuria, eGFR, and hematocrit were related to development of ESRD. 
      During 25 yr, 213 (1.7%) men developed ESRD. Predictors of ESRD were dipstick
      proteinuria of 1+ or > or =2+ (hazard ratio [HR] 3.1 [95% confidence interval
      (CI) 1.8 to 5.4] and 15.7 [95% CI 10.3 to 23.9] respectively) and an eGFR of <60 
      ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (HR 2.4; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.8). Correlation between eGFR and
      serum creatinine was 0.9; the risk for ESRD with a 1-SD difference of each was
      identical (HR 1.21). Bivariate analysis demonstrated a 41-fold increase in ESRD
      risk in those with an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) and > or =2+ proteinuria (95%
      CI 15.2 to 71.1). There was no association between hematocrit and ESRD. Other
      baseline measures that independently predicted ESRD included age, cigarette
      smoking, BP, low HDL cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Among middle-aged men who 
      were at high risk for cardiovascular disease but had no clinical evidence of
      cardiovascular disease or significant kidney disease, dipstick proteinuria and an
      eGFR value <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) were strong predictors of long-term
      development of ESRD. It remains unknown whether intervention for proteinuria or
      early identification of those with chronic kidney disease reduces the risk for
      ESRD.

      was to test the efficacy of six interventions designed to reduce alcohol
      consumption among designated drivers. METHOD: A total of 376 groups consisting of
      1,412 pedestrians (57.8% men) were recruited as they crossed into Tijuana,
      Mexico, from San Diego, CA. Before crossing into Mexico, each group was assigned 
      at random to one of six experimental conditions or to one control condition. The 
      six interventions were designed to (1) cue the use of designated drivers, (2)
      change attitudes about designated drivers, (3) provide monetary rewards for
      driver sobriety, and (4) increase group supportive norms for proper designated
      driver use. Participant breath alcohol concentrations (BrACs) were collected
      before entering Mexico and on return to the United States. RESULTS: Using group
      members to deliver pro-designated driver messages significantly decreased driver 
      and passenger BrACs relative to controls. Male drivers were more likely to return
      from Mexico with BrACs of zero if they were rewarded. Among female drivers,
      wearing a bracelet with the printed words "designated driver" in addition to
      cuing resulted in 9 of 10 drivers returning with BrACs equal to zero.
      CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that designated driver sobriety can be
      enhanced through brief interventions, and proper use of the designated driver
      concept did not increase the risk of excessive alcohol consumption for
      passengers.

TI  - Costs of a smoking cessation counseling intervention for pregnant women:
      comparison of three settings.
PG  - 120-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the rate of smoking among women giving birth in the United
      States has declined steadily from 19.5% in 1989 to 11.4% in 2002, it still far
      exceeds the Healthy People 2010 goal of 1%. The objective of this study was to
      estimate the costs of a recommended five-step smoking cessation counseling
      intervention for pregnant women. METHODS: Costs were compared across three
      settings: a clinical trial, a quit line, and a rural managed care organization.
      Cost data were collected from August 2002 to September 2003. Intervention costs
      were compared with potential neonatal cost savings from averted adverse outcomes 
      using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Maternal and
      Child Health Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economics Costs
      software. RESULTS: The costs of implementing the intervention ranged from dollar 
      24 to dollar 34 per pregnant smoker counseled across the three settings.
      Potential neonatal cost savings that could be accrued from women who quit smoking
      during pregnancy were estimated at dollar 881 per maternal smoker. Assuming a 30%
      to 70% increase over baseline quit rates, interventions could net savings up to
      dollar 8 million within the range of costs per pregnant smoker. CONCLUSIONS:
      Costs may vary depending on the intensity and nature of the intervention;
      however, this analysis found a surprisingly narrow range across three disparate
      settings. Cost estimates presented here are shown to be low compared with
      potential cost savings that could be accrued across the quit rates that could be 
      achieved through use of the 5A's smoking cessation counseling intervention.

TI  - [Randomized clinical trial: effectiveness of the cognitive-behavioral approach
      and the use of nicotine replacement transdermal patches for smoking cessation
      among adults in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].
PG  - 439-49
AB  - Randomized clinical trial carried out to investigate the effectiveness of the
      cognitive-behavioral approach and nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine
      patches for smoking cessation. Participated 1,199 adults, volunteers, in Rio de
      Janeiro, Brazil, randomly assigned to 10 different groups: intensive brief
      counseling group (GB), with 1 or 2 sessions (G1-G2), and with 3 or 4 sessions
      (G3-G4), with/without nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Abstinence proportions 
      were estimated during 12 months. These proportions among participants not
      assigned to NRT were 20% (GB), 17% (G1-G2), and 23% (G3-G4); and among assigned
      NRT groups were 30% (GBA), 34% (G1A-G2A), and 33% (G3A-G4A). After multiple
      adjustments, the abstinence proportions ratios seemed to follow a "dose-response"
      pattern: compared to GB, the ratios were 0.85 (G1-G2), 1.13 (G3-G4), 1.51 (GBA), 
      1.66 (G1A-G2A), and 1.75 (G3A-G4A). The results suggest that use of NRT increases
      the abstinence proportion for cessation. The "dose-response" pattern suggests
      that cognitive-behavioral could be the reasonable option in the smoking cessation
      therapy.

TI  - Effects of lower-cost incentives on stimulant abstinence in methadone maintenance
      treatment: a National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network study.
PG  - 201-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contingency management interventions that provide tangible incentives
      based on objective indicators of drug abstinence have improved treatment outcomes
      of substance abusers, but have not been widely implemented in community drug
      abuse treatment settings. OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes achieved when a
      lower-cost prize-based contingency management treatment is added to usual care in
      community methadone hydrochloride maintenance treatment settings. DESIGN: Random 
      assignment to usual care with (n = 198) or without (n = 190) abstinence
      incentives during a 12-week trial. SETTING: Six community-based methadone
      maintenance drug abuse treatment clinics in locations across the United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred eighty-eight stimulant-abusing patients enrolled in
      methadone maintenance programs for at least 1 month and no more than 3 years.
      INTERVENTION: Participants submitting stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples
      earned draws for a chance to win prizes; the number of draws earned increased
      with continuous abstinence time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total number of
      stimulant- and alcohol-negative samples provided, percentage of stimulant- and
      alcohol-negative samples provided, longest duration of abstinence, retention, and
      counseling attendance. RESULTS: Submission of stimulant- and alcohol-negative
      samples was twice as likely for incentive as for usual care group participants
      (odds ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-2.77). Achieving 4 or more, 8 or
      more, and 12 weeks of continuous abstinence was approximately 3, 9, and 11 times 
      more likely, respectively, for incentive vs usual care participants. Groups did
      not differ on study retention or counseling attendance. The average cost of
      prizes was 120 dollars per participant. CONCLUSION: An abstinence incentive
      approach that paid 120 dollars in prizes per participant effectively increased
      stimulant abstinence in community-based methadone maintenance treatment clinics.

TI  - Efficacy of auricular acupressure as an adjuvant therapy in substance abuse
      treatment: a pilot study.
PG  - 66-9
AB  - CONTEXT: Substance abuse and its related problems have become a serious public
      health issue, particularly in underserved border and rural communities.
      Conventional therapies have not always been effective. Literature regarding the
      use of auricular acupressure in substance abuse treatment is limited. OBJECTIVE: 
      To examine the efficacy of auricular acupressure in addition to usual care in
      substance abuse treatment, which has been limited. DESIGN AND SETTING: This
      placebo-controlled pilot study was carried out in a community mental health
      center in a US-Mexico border city (Las Cruces) in southwestern New Mexico.
      PARTICIPANTS: A majority were Hispanic males with an average age of 32.8 years.
      Participants reported an average lifetime use of drug of choice of 14 years.
      INTERVENTION: In addition to usual care, participants received specific
      acupressure treatment and placebo acupressure treatment. The acupressure
      treatment was offered once a week for 6 consecutive weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      The Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) Depression Scale was administered before
      and after 6 weeks of treatment to assess changes in emotional distress. Brief
      Substance Craving Scale was used at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks to assess
      changes in craving. RESULTS: Both specific and placebo acupressure groups showed 
      a significant reduction in craving at the end of treatment, with the specific
      acupressure group having a greater and more steady reduction in craving. Both
      specific acupressure and usual-care-only groups demonstrated a significant
      reduction in emotional stress. CONCLUSION: Overall, there was a positive response
      to the specific auricular acupressure treatment on psychological distress,
      craving, and drug/alcohol use measures. These encouraging preliminary results
      need to be duplicated in studies with larger sample sizes and longer treatment
      phases.

TI  - Utilization of DXA Bone Mineral Densitometry in Ontario: An Evidence-Based
      Analysis.
PG  - 1-180
AB  - ISSUE: Systematic reviews and analyses of administrative data were performed to
      determine the appropriate use of bone mineral density (BMD) assessments using
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the associated trends in wrist and
      hip fractures in Ontario. BACKGROUND: DUAL ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY BONE
      MINERAL DENSITY ASSESSMENT: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry bone densitometers
      measure bone density based on differential absorption of 2 x-ray beams by bone
      and soft tissues. It is the gold standard for detecting and diagnosing
      osteoporosis, a systemic disease characterized by low bone density and altered
      bone structure, resulting in low bone strength and increased risk of fractures.
      The test is fast (approximately 10 minutes) and accurate (exceeds 90% at the
      hip), with low radiation (1/3 to 1/5 of that from a chest x-ray). DXA
      densitometers are licensed as Class 3 medical devices in Canada. The World Health
      Organization has established criteria for osteoporosis and osteopenia based on
      DXA BMD measurements: osteoporosis is defined as a BMD that is >2.5 standard
      deviations below the mean BMD for normal young adults (i.e. T-score <-2.5), while
      osteopenia is defined as BMD that is more than 1 standard deviation but less than
      2.5 standard deviation below the mean for normal young adults (i.e. T-score< -1 &
      >/=-2.5). DXA densitometry is presently an insured health service in Ontario.
      CLINICAL NEED: BURDEN OF DISEASE: The Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study
      (CaMos) found that 16% of Canadian women and 6.6% of Canadian men have
      osteoporosis based on the WHO criteria, with prevalence increasing with age.
      Osteopenia was found in 49.6% of Canadian women and 39% of Canadian men. In
      Ontario, it is estimated that nearly 530,000 Ontarians have some degrees of
      osteoporosis. Osteoporosis-related fragility fractures occur most often in the
      wrist, femur and pelvis. These fractures, particularly those in the hip, are
      associated with increased mortality, and decreased functional capacity and
      quality of life. A Canadian study showed that at 1 year after a hip fracture, the
      mortality rate was 20%. Another 20% required institutional care, 40% were unable 
      to walk independently, and there was lower health-related quality of life due to 
      attributes such as pain, decreased mobility and decreased ability to self-care.
      The cost of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures in Canada was estimated to be
      $1.3 billion in 1993. GUIDELINES FOR BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING: With 2
      exceptions, almost all guidelines address only women. None of the guidelines
      recommend blanket population-based BMD testing. Instead, all guidelines recommend
      BMD testing in people at risk of osteoporosis, predominantly women aged 65 years 
      or older. For women under 65 years of age, BMD testing is recommended only if one
      major or two minor risk factors for osteoporosis exist. Osteoporosis Canada did
      not restrict its recommendations to women, and thus their guidelines apply to
      both sexes. Major risk factors are age greater than or equal to 65 years, a
      history of previous fractures, family history (especially parental history) of
      fracture, and medication or disease conditions that affect bone metabolism (such 
      as long-term glucocorticoid therapy). Minor risk factors include low body mass
      index, low calcium intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking. CURRENT FUNDING FOR 
      BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING: The Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP)
      Schedule presently reimburses DXA BMD at the hip and spine. Measurements at both 
      sites are required if feasible. Patients at low risk of accelerated bone loss are
      limited to one BMD test within any 24-month period, but there are no restrictions
      on people at high risk. The total fee including the professional and technical
      components for a test involving 2 or more sites is $106.00 (Cdn). METHOD OF
      REVIEW: This review consisted of 2 parts. The first part was an analysis of
      Ontario administrative data relating to DXA BMD, wrist and hip fractures, and use
      of antiresorptive drugs in people aged 65 years and older. The Institute for
      Clinical Evaluative Sciences extracted data from the OHIP claims database, the
      Canadian Institute for Health Information hospital discharge abstract database,
      the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System, and the Ontario Drug Benefit
      database using OHIP and ICD-10 codes. The data was analyzed to examine the trends
      in DXA BMD use from 1992 to 2005, and to identify areas requiring improvement.
      The second part included systematic reviews and analyses of evidence relating to 
      issues identified in the analyses of utilization data. Altogether, 8 reviews and 
      qualitative syntheses were performed, consisting of 28 published systematic
      reviews and/or meta-analyses, 34 randomized controlled trials, and 63
      observational studies. FINDINGS OF UTILIZATION ANALYSIS: Analysis of
      administrative data showed a 10-fold increase in the number of BMD tests in
      Ontario between 1993 and 2005.OHIP claims for BMD tests are presently increasing 
      at a rate of 6 to 7% per year. Approximately 500,000 tests were performed in
      2005/06 with an age-adjusted rate of 8,600 tests per 100,000 population.Women
      accounted for 90 % of all BMD tests performed in the province.In 2005/06, there
      was a 2-fold variation in the rate of DXA BMD tests across local integrated
      health networks, but a 10-fold variation between the county with the highest rate
      (Toronto) and that with the lowest rate (Kenora). The analysis also showed
      that:With the increased use of BMD, there was a concomitant increase in the use
      of antiresorptive drugs (as shown in people 65 years and older) and a decrease in
      the rate of hip fractures in people age 50 years and older.Repeat BMD made up
      approximately 41% of all tests. Most of the people (>90%) who had annual BMD
      tests in a 2-year or 3-year period were coded as being at high risk for
      osteoporosis.18% (20,865) of the people who had a repeat BMD within a 24-month
      period and 34% (98,058) of the people who had one BMD test in a 3-year period
      were under 65 years, had no fracture in the year, and coded as low-risk.Only 19% 
      of people age greater than 65 years underwent BMD testing and 41% received
      osteoporosis treatment during the year following a fracture.Men accounted for 24%
      of all hip fractures and 21 % of all wrist fractures, but only 10% of BMD tests. 
      The rates of BMD tests and treatment in men after a fracture were only half of
      those in women.In both men and women, the rate of hip and wrist fractures mainly 
      increased after age 65 with the sharpest increase occurring after age 80 years.
      FINDINGS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND ANALYSIS: SERIAL BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING
      FOR PEOPLE NOT RECEIVING OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT: A systematic review showed that 
      the mean rate of bone loss in people not receiving osteoporosis treatment
      (including postmenopausal women) is generally less than 1% per year. Higher rates
      of bone loss were reported for people with disease conditions or on medications
      that affect bone metabolism. In order to be considered a genuine biological
      change, the change in BMD between serial measurements must exceed the least
      significant change (variability) of the testing, ranging from 2.77% to 8% for
      precisions ranging from 1% to 3% respectively. Progression in BMD was analyzed,
      using different rates of baseline BMD values, rates of bone loss, precision, and 
      BMD value for initiating treatment. The analyses showed that serial BMD
      measurements every 24 months (as per OHIP policy for low-risk individuals) is not
      necessary for people with no major risk factors for osteoporosis, provided that
      the baseline BMD is normal (T-score >/= -1), and the rate of bone loss is less
      than or equal to 1% per year. The analyses showed that for someone with a normal 
      baseline BMD and a rate of bone loss of less than 1% per year, the change in BMD 
      is not likely to exceed least significant change (even for a 1% precision) in
      less than 3 years after the baseline test, and is not likely to drop to a BMD
      level that requires initiation of treatment in less than 16 years after the
      baseline test. SERIAL BONE MINERAL DENSITY TESTING IN PEOPLE RECEIVING
      OSTEOPOROSIS THERAPY: Seven published meta-analysis of randomized controlled
      trials (RCTs) and 2 recent RCTs on BMD monitoring during osteoporosis therapy
      showed that although higher increases in BMD were generally associated with
      reduced risk of fracture, the change in BMD only explained a small percentage of 
      the fracture risk reduction.Studies showed that some people with small or no
      increase in BMD during treatment experienced significant fracture risk reduction,
      indicating that other factors such as improved bone microarchitecture might have 
      contributed to fracture risk reduction.There is conflicting evidence relating to 
      the role of BMD testing in improving patient compliance with osteoporosis
      therapy.Even though BMD may not be a perfect surrogate for reduction in fracture 
      risk when monitoring responses to osteoporosis therapy, experts advised that it
      is still the only reliable test available for this purpose.A systematic review
      conducted by the Medical Advisory Secretariat showed that the magnitude of
      increases in BMD during osteoporosis drug therapy varied among medications.
      Although most of the studies yielded mean percentage increases in BMD from
      baseline that did not exceed the least significant change for a 2% precision
      after 1 year of treatment, there were some exceptions. BONE MINERAL DENSITY
      TESTING AND TREATMENT AFTER A FRAGILITY FRACTURE: A review of 3 published pooled 
      analyses of observational studies and 12 prospective population-based
      observational studies showed that the presence of any prevalent fracture
      increases the relative risk for future fractures by approximately 2-fold or more.

TI  - The importance of providing smoking relapse counseling during the postpartum
      hospitalization.
PG  - 703-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine during the postpartum period (a) the most feasible time 
      for addressing smoking relapse, (b) the reasons women relapse, (c) differences in
      relapse rates in women who receive a counseling intervention in the immediate
      postpartum period compared to those who do not, and (d) differences in
      self-reporting of tobacco use compared to cotinine analysis. DESIGN: Randomized
      clinical trial. SETTING: Medical center in the Northeast United States and two
      prenatal care sites. PARTICIPANTS: A nonprobability convenience sample of 62
      pregnant women. INTERVENTION: A brief counseling session using empowerment
      techniques, motivational interviewing, identification of stressors and individual
      coping strategies, and educational materials. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: Relapse to
      smoking measured by cotinine analysis and descriptive data collected during the
      antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of
      women relapsed to smoking by the 2nd week postdelivery, identifying rest and
      relaxation and depression as main factors for relapsing. Chi-square analysis
      showed no significant difference between the two groups regarding the
      intervention provided. There was a 39% discrepancy rate between self-reporting of
      tobacco use and cotinine analysis during pregnancy and a 27% discrepancy rate
      after delivery. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high occurrence of relapse in the
      first 2 weeks after delivery, it is imperative that nurses provide interventions 
      to women before their postpartum hospital discharge to prevent smoking relapse.
      Nurses should also address smoking behaviors each trimester because women stopped
      smoking at different time intervals and self-reported data were unreliable.

TI  - Non-adherence among patients initiating antiretroviral therapy: a challenge for
      health professionals in Brazil.
PG  - S5-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence, magnitude and factors associated with the
      first episode of non-adherence for 12 months after the first antiretroviral
      prescription. DESIGN: A prospective study of HIV-infected patients receiving
      their first antiretroviral prescription in public referral centers, Belo
      Horizonte, Brazil. Baseline assessment occurred at the moment of the first
      prescription and follow-up visits at the first, fourth and seventh month, from
      May 2001 to May 2003. METHODS: Non-adherence was self-reported and defined as the
      intake of less than 95% of the prescribed doses for 3 days before the follow-up
      interviews. Cumulative and person-time incidence were estimated and Cox's
      proportional model was used to assess the relative hazard (RH) of non-adherence
      with 95% confidence interval for both univariate and multivariate analysis.
      RESULTS: Among 306 patients, the cumulative incidence of non-adherence was 36.9% 
      (incidence rate 0.21/100 person-days). Multivariate analysis (P < 0.05) showed
      that unemployment (RH = 2.17), alcohol use (RH = 2.27), self-report of three or
      more adverse reactions (RH = 1.64), number of pills per day (RH = 2.04), switch
      in antiretroviral regimen (RH = 2.72), and a longer time between the HIV test
      result and the first antiretroviral prescription (RH = 2.27) were associated with
      an increased risk of non-adherence, whereas the use of more than one health
      service indicated a negative association (RH = 0.54). CONCLUSION: The current
      analysis has pointed out the importance of clinical and health service
      characteristics as potential indicators of non-adherence after initiating
      therapy. Early assessment and intervention strategies should be priorities in
      these AIDS public referral centres. Feasible and reliable indicators for the
      routine monitoring of adherence should be incorporated in clinical practice.

TI  - Mandatory alcohol intervention for alcohol-abusing college students: a systematic
      review.
PG  - 147-58
AB  - Most colleges and universities in the United States have programmatic responses
      for alcohol policy violators that commonly include some form of mandatory alcohol
      education or counseling. The purpose of this study was to conduct a review of
      intervention programs for college students who are required to attend alcohol
      education or counseling. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases were searched for 
      reports of college-based mandatory interventions offered on American campuses.
      When possible, within-group and between-group effect sizes were calculated.
      Sixteen reports were identified, including three randomized controlled trials.
      Most of the reviewed studies used qualitative or quasi-experimental designs, did 
      not include comparison or control groups, had small or selective sample sizes,
      lacked behavioral measures of alcohol consumption, and/or had no follow-up, low
      follow-up rates, or short follow-up intervals. Recommendations for future
      research include testing different modes and types of interventions and
      sanctions, evaluating long-term efficacy, and establishing cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Primary care provider attitudes are associated with smoking cessation counseling 
      and referral.
PG  - 929-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most primary care providers (PCPs) endorse the importance of smoking
      cessation, but counseling rates are low. We evaluated the consistency of PCP's
      attitudes toward smoking cessation counseling and corresponding smoking-cessation
      behaviors. DESIGN: This was a postintervention analysis of a population-based
      sample from a group randomized controlled trial to improve adherence to smoking
      cessation guidelines. SETTING: A total of 18 VA sites in Southwestern and Western
      United States participated. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 PCPs completed a survey 
      at 12 months after the implementation of a smoking-cessation quality improvement 
      (QI) program. Their patients also completed 12- (n = 1080) and 18-month (n = 924)
      follow-up surveys. INTERVENTION: The quality improvement intervention included
      local priority setting, quality improvement plan development, implementation, and
      monitoring. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: PCPs at intervention sites were more
      likely to report counseling patients about smoking cessation (P = 0.04) but not
      referral. PCP attitude toward smoking-cessation counseling was strongly
      associated with reported counseling (P < 0.001) and with referral (P = 0.01).
      Other associations with counseling were the perceived barrier "patients are not
      interested in quitting" (P = 0.01) and fewer years in practice (P = 0.03); other 
      associations with referral were specialty consultation (P < 0.0001) and the
      perceived barrier "referral not convenient" (P = 0.001) (negative association).
      PCP attitudes were associated with higher rates of counseling, referral, and
      program attendance. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs, regardless of intervention participation, 
      had attitudes consistent with their reported smoking-cessation behaviors and more
      favorable attitudes were associated with higher rates of patient-reported smoking
      cessation behavior. Findings suggest that PCPs who endorse smoking-cessation
      counseling and referral may provide more treatment recommendations and have
      higher patient quit rates.

TI  - Adherence to heart failure quality-of-care indicators in US hospitals: analysis
      of the ADHERE Registry.
PG  - 1469-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: Quality-of-care indicators have been developed for patients
      hospitalized with heart failure. However, little is known about current rates of 
      conformity with these indicators or their variability across hospitals. METHODS: 
      Data from 81 142 admissions occurring between July 1, 2002, and December 31,
      2003, at 223 academic and non-academic hospitals in the United States
      participating in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE)
      were analyzed. Rates of conformity with the 4 Joint Commission on Accreditation
      of Healthcare Organizations core performance measures--discharge instructions
      (HF-1), assessment of left ventricular function (HF-2), use of
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in patients with left ventricular
      systolic dysfunction (HF-3), and smoking cessation counseling (HF-4)--as well as 
      length of stay and in-hospital mortality rates were computed. RESULTS: Across all
      hospitals, the median rates of conformity with HF-1, HF-2, HF-3, and HF-4 were
      24.0%, 86.2%, 72.0%, and 43.2%, respectively. Rates of conformity at individual
      hospitals varied from 0% to 100%, with statistically significant differences
      between academic and non-academic hospitals. Statistically significant positive
      independent predictors of overall conformity included the prevalence of
      comorbidities and the use of more intense pharmacologic management. Median
      hospital length of stay varied from 2.3 to 9.5 days, and in-hospital mortality
      varied from 0% to 11.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Among hospitals providing care for patients
      with heart failure, there is significant individual variability in conformity to 
      quality-of-care indicators and clinical outcomes and a substantial gap in overall
      performance. Establishing educational initiatives and quality improvement systems
      to reduce this variability and eliminate this gap would be expected to
      substantially improve the care of these patients.

TI  - A randomized trial to promote pharmacotherapy use and smoking cessation in a
      Medicaid population (United States).
PG  - 373-82
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of three different intervention conditions
      designed to increase use of the Medicaid smoking cessation pharmacotherapy
      benefit and promote smoking cessation among Medicaid clients. METHODS: In 2002,
      608 current smokers receiving Medicaid benefits were recruited from the reception
      areas at the Department of Social Services in Erie County, New York, USA.
      Participants were randomized to one of three interventions: Minimal (verbal
      information on the Medicaid pharmacotherapy benefit), Self Help (verbal
      information plus self-help information materials), or Case Management (verbal
      information, self-help information, plus case management assistance to facilitate
      access to the pharmacotherapy benefit). Outcomes included (a) use of a
      stop-smoking medication during the three month follow-up period, (b)
      self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at three months and (c)
      bioverified non-smoking status at three months (bio-chemically validated by
      expired Carbon Monoxide (CO) < or =8 ppm). RESULTS: 14.6% reported using a
      stop-smoking medication and staying off cigarettes for 24 h, 4.6% self-reported
      being smoke-free at three months, and 1.8% were bioverified as smoke-free. There 
      were no differences by intervention group for these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: An
      intensive intervention designed to promote pharmacotherapy use and smoking
      cessation among Medicaid smokers was no more effective than less intensive
      interventions.

TI  - Crack use as a public health problem in Canada: call for an evaluation of 'safer 
      crack use kits'.
PG  - 185-8
AB  - Oral crack use (smoking) is a relatively neglected public health problem in
      Canada, in comparison to injection drug use (IDU). There are indications that
      crack use in Canada may be increasing. Crack smoking involves particular risks
      and harms, including possible infectious disease transmission, which underline
      the need for targeted interventions. One pragmatic grassroots intervention that
      has only recently begun or been discussed in several Canadian cities is the
      distribution of 'safer crack use kits', which provide hardware for crack smoking 
      devices along with harm reduction information. In addition to the direct benefits
      of using them, the kits may also bring previously 'hidden' marginalized crack
      smokers in contact with health and social services. There has been considerable
      controversy with regards to the distribution of the crack kits, within criminal
      justice, public health, and the general public; this resistance appears quite
      similar to that experienced when needle exchange programs (NEPs) were first being
      established. Systematic evaluation of the crack kits is urgently needed in order 
      to produce definitive evidence of their health and other benefits, and to allow
      for evidence-based program and policy decisions in the interest of public health.

TI  - Acute stroke care in the US: results from 4 pilot prototypes of the Paul
      Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry.
PG  - 1232-40
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry is
      being developed to improve the quality of acute stroke care. This article
      describes key features of acute stroke care from 4 prototype registries in
      Georgia (Ga), Massachusetts (Mass), Michigan (Mich), and Ohio. METHODS: Each
      prototype developed its own sampling scheme to obtain a representative sample of 
      hospitals. Acute stroke admissions were identified using prospective (Mass, Mich)
      or retrospective (Ga, Ohio) methods. All prototypes used a common set of case
      definitions and data elements. Weighted site-specific frequencies were generated 
      for each outcome. RESULTS: A total of 6867 admissions from 98 hospitals were
      included; the majority were ischemic strokes (range, 52% to 70%) with transient
      ischemic attack and intracerebral hemorrhage comprising the bulk of the
      remainder. Between 19% and 26% of admissions were younger than age 60 years, and 
      between 52% and 58% were female. Black subjects varied from 7.1% (Mich) to 30.6% 
      (Ga). Between 20% and 25% of admissions arrived at the emergency department
      within 3 hours of onset. Treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator 
      (rtPA) was administered to between 3.0% (Ga) and 8.5% (Mass) of ischemic stroke
      admissions. Of 118 subjects treated with intravenous rtPA, <20% received it
      within 60 minutes of arrival. Compliance with secondary prevention practices was 
      poorest for smoking cessation counseling and best for antithrombotics.
      CONCLUSIONS: A minority of acute stroke patients are treated according to
      established guidelines. Quality improvement interventions, targeted primarily at 
      the health care systems level, are needed to improve acute stroke care in the
      United States.

TI  - Factors associated with interest in initiating treatment for hepatitis C Virus
      (HCV) infection among young HCV-infected injection drug users.
PG  - S304-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to identify factors associated with interest in receiving
      therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among HCV-infected injection drug
      users (IDUs) in 3 United States cities. METHODS: IDUs aged 18-35 years who were
      HCV-infected and seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus underwent surveys 
      on behaviors, experience, and interest in treatment for HCV infection and
      readiness to quit drug use. RESULTS: Among treatment-naive IDUs (n=216), 81.5%
      were interested in treatment for HCV infection, but only 27.3% had seen a
      health-care provider since receiving a diagnosis of HCV infection. Interest in
      treatment for HCV infection was greater among IDUs with a high perceived threat
      of progressive liver disease, those with a usual source of care, those without
      evidence of alcohol dependence, and those with higher readiness scores for
      quitting drug use. Interest in treatment for HCV infection was 7-fold higher
      among IDUs who were told by their health-care provider that they were at risk for
      cirrhosis or liver cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Improving provider-patient communication 
      and integrating treatments for substance abuse and HCV may increase the
      proportion of IDUs who initiate treatment for HCV infection.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Canadian guidelines for diagnosis.
PG  - S1-S21
AB  - The diagnosis of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is complex and guidelines
      are warranted. A subcommittee of the Public Health Agency of Canada's National
      Advisory Committee on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder reviewed, analysed and
      integrated current approaches to diagnosis to reach agreement on a standard in
      Canada. The purpose of this paper is to review and clarify the use of current
      diagnostic systems and make recommendations on their application for diagnosis of
      FASD-related disabilities in people of all ages. The guidelines are based on
      widespread consultation of expert practitioners and partners in the field. The
      guidelines have been organized into 7 categories: screening and referral; the
      physical examination and differential diagnosis; the neurobehavioural assessment;
      and treatment and follow-up; maternal alcohol history in pregnancy; diagnostic
      criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS and alcohol-related
      neurodevelopmental disorder; and harmonization of Institute of Medicine and
      4-Digit Diagnostic Code approaches. The diagnosis requires a comprehensive
      history and physical and neurobehavioural assessments; a multidisciplinary
      approach is necessary. These are the first Canadian guidelines for the diagnosis 
      of FAS and its related disabilities, developed by broad-based consultation among 
      experts in diagnosis.

TI  - Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trials (CREST): lessons learned.
PG  - 102-10
AB  - AIMS: The Cocaine Rapid Efficacy Screening Trials (CREST) were designed by the
      National Institute on Drug Abuse Division of Treatment Research and Development
      (NIDA, DT R&D) to rapidly screen a number of medications potentially useful for
      the treatment of cocaine dependence. DESIGN: Each CREST trial was designed to
      compare several medications in a single trial against an unmatched placebo. The
      placebo group was included in each trial to avoid the nearly universal positive
      response to medications seen in open-label trials. In addition, a common set of
      procedures and outcome measures were employed throughout to increase
      comparability of results obtained from different trials and from different times.
      PARTICIPANTS: In all, 18 medications were screened in seven different trials,
      conducted in four different sites throughout the United States involving 398
      cocaine-dependent patients. FINDINGS: Three medications were found to be
      promising enough to include in subsequent larger trials. Common statistical
      procedures for evaluating medications were developed to facilitate comparisons
      across sites and across time. A portion of the data were pooled and analyzed,
      which yielded some useful insights into cocaine dependence and its treatment.
      Finally, a review of individual trials together with the pooled analysis revealed
      several potential improvements for future screening trials. CONCLUSIONS: Overall,
      the CREST trials proved to be useful for rapidly screening medications for
      treatment of cocaine dependence, but several modifications in design should be
      made before this framework is applied further.

TI  - Active ingredients: how and why evidence-based alcohol behavioral treatment
      interventions work.
PG  - 235-47
AB  - This article summarizes the proceedings of a symposium that was organized and
      chaired by Richard Longabaugh and presented at the 2004 Research Society on
      Alcoholism meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The aim of the
      presentation was to focus on evidence for the active ingredients of behavioral
      therapies for patients with alcohol use disorders. Dennis M. Donovan, PhD,
      reviewed evidence for the active ingredients of cognitive behavioral therapy.
      Barbara S. McCrady, PhD, presented a conceptual model for mechanisms of change in
      alcohol behavior couples therapy and reviewed evidence for this model. J. Scott
      Tonigan, PhD, presented data testing three hypothesized mechanisms of change in
      twelve-step facilitation treatment. Mitchell P. Karno, PhD, presented therapy
      process data that tested whether matching therapist behaviors to client attribute
      across three therapies affected drinking outcomes. Jon Morgenstern served as
      discussant.

TI  - Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a best-evidence systematic review for
      the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 203-11
AB  - BACKGROUND: While the prognosis for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture is
      poor, ultrasound imaging is an accurate and reliable test for detecting AAAs
      before rupture. PURPOSE: To examine the benefits and harms of population-based
      AAA screening. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (1994 to July 2004) supplemented by the
      Cochrane Library, a reference list of retrieved articles, and expert suggestions.
      STUDY SELECTION: Randomized trials of AAA population screening, population
      studies of AAA risk factors, and data on adverse screening and treatment events
      from randomized trials and cohort studies. DATA EXTRACTION: All studies were
      reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined criteria. DATA
      SYNTHESIS: The authors identified 4 population-based randomized, controlled
      trials of AAA screening in men 65 years of age and older. On the basis of
      meta-analysis, an invitation to attend screening was associated with a
      significant reduction in AAA-related mortality (odds ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.45 to
      0.74]). A meta-analysis of 3 trials revealed no significant difference in
      all-cause mortality (odds ratio, 0.98 [CI, 0.95 to 1.02]). No significant
      reduction in AAA-related mortality was found in 1 study of AAA screening in
      women. Screening does not appear to be associated with significant physical or
      psychological harms. Major treatment harms include an operative mortality rate of
      2% to 6% and significant risk for major complications. LIMITATIONS: The
      population screening studies focused on men and provided no information on racial
      or ethnic groups. No information was available on uninvited control group
      characteristics, so the importance of risk factors such as tobacco use or family 
      history could not be assessed. Since all trials were conducted in countries other
      than the United States, generalizability to the U.S. population is uncertain.
      CONCLUSION: For men age 65 to 75 years, an invitation to attend AAA screening
      reduces AAA-related mortality.

TI  - Addressing tobacco in managed care: results of the 2002 survey.
PG  - A04
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the United States, tobacco use is the leading preventable cause 
      of death and disease. The health and cost consequences of tobacco dependence have
      made treatment and prevention of tobacco use a key priority among multiple
      stakeholders, including health plans, insurers, providers, employers, and
      policymakers. In 2002, the third survey of tobacco control practices and policies
      in health plans was conducted by America's Health Insurance Plans' technical
      assistance office as part of the Addressing Tobacco in Managed Care (ATMC)
      program. METHODS: The ATMC survey was conducted in the spring of 2002 via mail,
      e-mail, and fax. A 19-item survey instrument was developed and pilot-tested. Of
      the 19 items, 12 were the same as in previous years, four were modified to
      collect more detailed data on areas of key interest, and three were added to gain
      information about strategies to promote smoking cessation. The sample for the
      survey was drawn from the 687 plans listed in the national directory of member
      and nonmember health plans in America's Health Insurance Plans. RESULTS: Of the
      246 plans in the sample, 152 plans (62%) representing more than 43.5 million
      health maintenance organization members completed the survey. Results show that
      health plans are using evidence-based programs and clinical guidelines to address
      tobacco use. Compared to ATMC survey data collected in 1997 and 2000, the 2002
      ATMC survey results indicate that more health plans are providing full coverage
      for first-line pharmacotherapies and telephone counseling for smoking cessation. 
      Plans have also shown improvement in their ability to identify at least some
      members who smoke. Similarly, a greater percentage of plans are employing
      strategies to address smoking cessation during the postpartum period to prevent
      smoking relapse and during pediatric visits to reduce or eliminate children's
      exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. CONCLUSION: The results of the 2002 ATMC
      survey reflect both tremendous accomplishments and important opportunities for
      health plans to collaborate in tobacco control efforts. With appropriate support,
      analytical tools, and resources, it is likely that health plans, clinicians,
      providers, and consumers will continue to evolve in their efforts to reduce the
      negative consequences of tobacco use.

TI  - Bariatric surgery: an evidence-based analysis.
PG  - 1-148
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To conduct an evidence-based analysis of the effectiveness and
      cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery. BACKGROUND: Obesity is defined as a body
      mass index (BMI) of at last 30 kg/m(2).() Morbid obesity is defined as a BMI of
      at least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions. Comorbid
      conditions associated with obesity include diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias,
      obstructive sleep apnea, weight-related arthropathies, and stress urinary
      incontinence. It is also associated with depression, and cancers of the breast,
      uterus, prostate, and colon, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular
      disease. Obesity is also associated with higher all-cause mortality at any age,
      even after adjusting for potential confounding factors like smoking. A person
      with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) has about a 50% higher risk of dying than does someone
      with a healthy BMI. The risk more than doubles at a BMI of 35 kg/m(2). An expert 
      estimated that about 160,000 people are morbidly obese in Ontario. In the United 
      States, the prevalence of morbid obesity is 4.7% (1999-2000). In Ontario, the
      2004 Chief Medical Officer of Health Report said that in 2003, almost one-half of
      Ontario adults were overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/m(2)) or obese (BMI >/= 30
      kg/m(2)). About 57% of Ontario men and 42% of Ontario women were overweight or
      obese. The proportion of the population that was overweight or obese increased
      gradually from 44% in 1990 to 49% in 2000, and it appears to have stabilized at
      49% in 2003. The report also noted that the tendency to be overweight and obese
      increases with age up to 64 years. BMI should be used cautiously for people aged 
      65 years and older, because the "normal" range may begin at slightly above 18.5
      kg/m(2) and extend into the "overweight" range. The Chief Medical Officer of
      Health cautioned that these data may underestimate the true extent of the
      problem, because they were based on self reports, and people tend to over-report 
      their height and under-report their weight. The actual number of Ontario adults
      who are overweight or obese may be higher. Diet, exercise, and behavioural
      therapy are used to help people lose weight. The goals of behavioural therapy are
      to identify, monitor, and alter behaviour that does not help weight loss.
      Techniques include self-monitoring of eating habits and physical activity, stress
      management, stimulus control, problem solving, cognitive restructuring,
      contingency management, and identifying and using social support. Relapse, when
      people resume old, unhealthy behaviour and then regain the weight, can be
      problematic. Drugs (including gastrointestinal lipase inhibitors, serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and appetite suppressants) may be used if
      behavioural interventions fail. However, estimates of efficacy may be confounded 
      by high rates of noncompliance, in part owing to the side effects of the drugs.
      In addition, the drugs have not been approved for indefinite use, despite the
      chronic nature of obesity. THE TECHNOLOGY: Morbidly obese people may be eligible 
      for bariatric surgery. Bariatric surgery for morbid obesity is considered an
      intervention of last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of
      medical management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural
      modification, and drugs. There are various bariatric surgical procedures and
      several different variations for each of these procedures. The surgical
      interventions can be divided into 2 general types: malabsorptive (bypassing parts
      of the gastrointestinal tract to limit the absorption of food), and restrictive
      (decreasing the size of the stomach so that the patient is satiated with less
      food). All of these may be performed as either open surgery or laparoscopically. 
      An example of a malabsorptive technique is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).
      Examples of restrictive techniques are vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) and
      adjustable gastric banding (AGB). The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP)
      Schedule of Benefits for Physician Services includes fee code "S120 gastric
      bypass or partition, for morbid obesity" as an insured service. The term gastric 
      bypass is a general term that encompasses a variety of surgical methods, all of
      which involve reconfiguring the digestive system. The term gastric bypass does
      not include AGB. The number of gastric bypass procedures funded and done in
      Ontario, and funded as actual out-of-country approvals,() is shown below. Number 
      of Gastric Bypass Procedures by Fiscal Year: Ontario and Actual Out-of-Country
      (OOC) ApprovalsData from Provider Services, MOHLTCCourtesy of Provider Services, 
      Ministry of Health and Long Term Care REVIEW STRATEGY: The Medical Advisory
      Secretariat reviewed the literature to assess the effectiveness, safety, and
      cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery to treat morbid obesity. It used its
      standard search strategy to retrieve international health technology assessments 
      and English-language journal articles from selected databases. The interventions 
      of interest were bariatric surgery and, for the controls, either optimal
      conventional management or another type of bariatric procedure. The outcomes of
      interest were improvement in comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension); 
      short- and long-term weight loss; quality of life; adverse effects; and economic 
      analysis data. The databases yielded 15 international health technology
      assessments or systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Subsequently, the Medical
      Advisory Secretariat searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from April 2004 to December
      2004, after the search cut-off date of April, 2004, for the most recent
      systematic reviews on bariatric surgery. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. 
      One of those 10 was the Swedish Obese Subjects study, which started as a registry
      and intervention study, and then published findings on people who had been
      enrolled for at least 2 years or at least 10 years. In addition to the literature
      review of economic analysis data, the Medical Advisory Secretariat also did an
      Ontario-based economic analysis. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Bariatric surgery generally
      is effective for sustained weight loss of about 16% for people with BMIs of at
      least 40 kg/m(2) or at least 35 kg/m(2) with comorbid conditions (including
      diabetes, high lipid levels, and hypertension). It also is effective at resolving
      the associated comorbid conditions. This conclusion is largely based on level 3a 
      evidence from the prospectively designed Swedish Obese Subjects study, which
      recently published 10-year outcomes for patients who had bariatric surgery
      compared with patients who received nonsurgical treatment. (1)Regarding specific 
      procedures, there is evidence that malabsorptive techniques are better than other
      banding techniques for weight loss and resolution of comorbid illnesses. However,
      there are no published prospective, long-term, direct comparisons of these
      techniques available.Surgery for morbid obesity is considered an intervention of 
      last resort for patients who have attempted first-line forms of medical
      management, such as diet, increased physical activity, behavioural modification, 
      and drugs. In the absence of direct comparisons of active nonsurgical
      intervention via caloric restriction with bariatric techniques, the following
      observations are made:A recent systematic review examining the efficacy of major 
      commercial and organized self-help weight loss programs in the United States
      concluded that the evidence to support the use of such programs was suboptimal,
      except for one trial on Weight Watchers. Furthermore, the programs were
      associated with high costs, attrition rates, and probability of regaining at
      least 50% of the lost weight in 1 to 2 years. (2)A recent randomized controlled
      trial reported 1-year outcomes comparing weight loss and metabolic changes in
      severely obese patients assigned to either a low-carbohydrate diet or a
      conventional weight loss diet. At 1 year, weight loss was similar for patients in
      each group (mean, 2-5 kg). There was a favourable effect on triglyceride levels
      and glycemic control in the low-carbohydrate diet group. (3)A decision-analysis
      model showed bariatric surgery results in increased life expectancy in morbidly
      obese patients when compared to diet and exercise. (4)A cost-effectiveness model 
      showed bariatric surgery is cost-effective relative to nonsurgical management.
      (5)Extrapolating from 2003 data from the United States, Ontario would likely need
      to do 3,500 bariatric surgeries per year. It currently does 508 per year,
      including out-of-country surgeries.

TI  - A meta-analysis of .08 BAC laws in 19 jurisdictions in the United States.
PG  - 149-61
AB  - More than a dozen studies on the effectiveness of the .08 blood alcohol
      concentration (BAC) laws have been published; however, those studies have varied 
      both in the statistical methods and the type of outcome measure used, so it is
      difficult to integrate the findings into an overall estimate of the effectiveness
      of the law. This study used a consistent outcome measure, drinking drivers in
      fatal crashes and an identical methodology time-series analysis, to analyze the
      introduction of the .08 law in 18 states and the District of Columbia from 1982
      to 2000. Each analysis accounted for other key safety laws (administrative
      license suspension/revocation and safety belt laws), as well as economic
      conditions that might influence the effectiveness of the .08 law. This provided
      19 independent evaluations in which the effectiveness (treatment effect) of the
      law could be measured in the same quantitative terms. The number of drinking
      drivers in fatal crashes declined in 16 of the 19 jurisdictions after the .08 law
      was adopted. Nine of the 16 reductions were statistically significant (p < .05). 
      The effect size combined across all 19 locations showed statistically significant
      decline (p < .005) of 14.8% in the rate of drinking drivers in fatal crashes
      after the .08 laws were introduced. The reduction was greater in states that had 
      an administrative license suspension/revocation law and implemented frequent
      sobriety checkpoints. This analysis suggests that 947 lives might have been
      saved, had all 50 states and the District of Columbia had the .08 law throughout 
      the year 2000.

TI  - A qualitative study of substance use and sexual behavior among 18- to 29-year-old
      men while incarcerated in the United States.
PG  - 775-89
AB  - The article describes men's perceptions of and experience with substance use and 
      sexual behavior during incarceration. Grounded theory content analyses were
      performed on qualitative interviews conducted with 80 men, aged 18 to 29, in four
      U.S. states. Participants believed that drugs were easily available in prison.
      Half reported using substances, primarily marijuana or alcohol, while
      incarcerated. Key themes included the role of correctional personnel in the flow 
      of substances in prison and the economic significance of substance trafficking.
      With regard to sexual behavior, most men acknowledged that it occurred but were
      hesitant to talk in-depth about it. There was a strong belief in "don't look,
      don't tell," and sex in prison was often associated with homosexual behavior or
      identity. Sex during incarceration was reported by 12 men, mostly with female
      partners. Participants were pessimistic about HIV/STD/hepatitis prevention
      efforts inside correctional facilities. These findings highlight the need for
      risk reduction programs for incarcerated men.

TI  - State of the Art Compendium: Canadian Thoracic Society recommendations for the
      management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 7B-59B
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of disability and 
      death in Canada. Moreover, morbidity and mortality from COPD continue to rise,
      and the economic burden is enormous. The main goal of the Canadian Thoracic
      Society's evidence-based guidelines is to optimize early diagnosis, prevention
      and management of COPD in Canada. The main message of the guidelines is that COPD
      is a preventable and treatable disease. Targeted spirometry is strongly
      recommended to expedite early diagnosis in smokers and former smokers who develop
      respiratory symptoms, and who are at risk for COPD. Smoking cessation remains the
      single most effective intervention to reduce the risk of COPD and to slow its
      progression. Education, especially self-management plans, are key interventions
      in COPD. Therapy should be escalated on an individual basis in accordance with
      the increasing severity of symptoms and disability. Long-acting anticholinergics 
      and beta-2-agonist inhalers should be prescribed for patients who remain
      symptomatic despite short-acting bronchodilator therapy. Inhaled steroids should 
      not be used as first line therapy in COPD, but have a role in preventing
      exacerbations in patients with more advanced disease who suffer recurrent
      exacerbations. Acute exacerbations of COPD cause significant morbidity and
      mortality and should be treated promptly with bronchodilators and a short course 
      of oral steroids; antibiotics should be prescribed for purulent exacerbations.
      Patients with advanced COPD and respiratory failure require a comprehensive
      management plan that incorporates structured end-of-life care. Management
      strategies, consisting of combined modern pharmacotherapy and
      nonpharmacotherapeutic interventions (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise
      training) can effectively improve symptoms, activity levels and quality of life, 
      even in patients with severe COPD.

TI  - Prevalence and predictors of depression treatment in an international primary
      care study.
PG  - 1626-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and predictors
      of depression treatment in a diverse cross-national sample of primary care
      patients. METHOD: At primary care facilities in six countries (Spain, Israel,
      Australia, Brazil, Russia, and the United States), a two-stage screening process 
      was used to identify 1,117 patients with current depressive disorder. At
      baseline, all patients completed a structured diagnostic interview as well as
      measures of anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, chronic comorbid physical conditions, 
      and perceived barriers to treatment. Primary care physicians were advised if the 
      research interview indicated a probable depressive disorder in their patients.
      Three and 9 months later, participants reported all health services (including
      specialty mental health care and antidepressant medication) used in the preceding
      3 months. RESULTS: Across the six sites, the proportion of patients receiving any
      antidepressant pharmacotherapy ranged from a high of 38% in Seattle to a low of
      0% in St. Petersburg; the proportion receiving any specialty mental health care
      varied from a high of 29% in Melbourne to a low of 3% in St. Petersburg. Patient 
      characteristics were not consistently associated with receipt of either
      pharmacotherapy or specialty mental health care. Out-of-pocket cost was the most 
      commonly reported barrier to treatment for depression; the percentage of patients
      who reported this barrier ranged from 24% in Barcelona to 75% in St. Petersburg. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Depression screening and physician notification are not sufficient
      to prompt adequate treatment for depression. The probability of treatment may be 
      more influenced by characteristics of health care systems than by the clinical
      characteristics of individual patients. Financial barriers may be more important 
      than stigma as impediments to appropriate care.

TI  - Narcotic antagonists in drug dependence: pilot study showing enhancement of
      compliance with SYN-10, amino-acid precursors and enkephalinase inhibition
      therapy.
PG  - 538-48
AB  - We decided to test the hypothesis that possibly by combining a narcotic
      antagonist and amino-acid therapy consisting of an enkephalinase inhibitor
      (D-phenylalanine) and neurotransmitter precursors (L-amino- acids) to promote
      neuronal dopamine release might enhance compliance in methadone patients rapidly 
      detoxified with the narcotic antagonist Trexan (Dupont, Delaware). In this
      regard, Thanos et al. [J. Neurochem. 78 (2001) 1094] and associates found
      increases in the dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2) via adenoviral vector delivery of
      the DRD2 gene into the nucleus accumbens, significantly reduced both ethanol
      preference (43%) and alcohol intake (64%) of ethanol preferring rats, which
      recovered as the DRD2, returned to baseline levels. This DRD2 overexpression
      similarly produced significant reductions in ethanol non-preferring rats, in both
      alcohol preference (16%) and alcohol intake (75%). This work further suggests
      that high levels of DRD2 may be protective against alcohol abuse [JAMA 263 (1990)
      2055; Arch, Gen. Psychiatr. 48 (1991) 648]. The DRD2 A1 allele has also been
      shown to associate with heroin addicts in a number of studies. In addition, other
      dopaminergic receptor gene polymorphisms have also associated with opioid
      dependence. For example, Kotler et al. [Mol. Phychiatr. 3 (1997) 251] showed that
      the 7 repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor is significantly overpresented in the
      opioid-dependent cohort and confers a relative risk of 2.46. This has been
      confirmed by Li et al. [Mol. Psychiatry 2 (1997) 413] for both the 5 and 7 repeat
      alleles in Han Chinese case control sample of heroin addicts. Similarly Duaux et 
      al. [Mol. Psychiatry 3 (1998) 333] in French Heroin addicts, found a significant 
      association with homozygotes alleles of the DRD3-Bal 1. A study from NIAAA,
      provided evidence which strongly suggests that DRD2 is a susceptibility gene for 
      substance abusers across multiple populations (2003). Moreover, there are a
      number of studies utilizing amino-acid and enkephalinase inhibition therapy
      showing reduction of alcohol, opiate, cocaine and sugar craving behavior in human
      trials (see Table 1). Over the last decade, a new rapid method to detoxify either
      methadone or heroin addicts utilizing Trexan sparked interest in many treatment
      centers throughout the United States, Canada, as well as many countries on a
      worldwide basis. In using the combination of Trexan and amino-acids, results were
      dramatic in terms of significantly enhancing compliance to continue taking
      Trexan. The average number of days of compliance calculated on 1000 patients,
      without amino-acid therapy, using this rapid detoxification method is only 37
      days. In contrast, the 12 subjects tested, receiving both the Trexan and
      amino-acid therapy was relapse-free or reported taking the combination for an
      average of 262 days (p < 0.0001F). Thus coupling amino-acid therapy and
      enkephalinase inhibition while blocking the delta-receptors with a pure narcotic 
      antagonist may be quite promising as a novel method to induce rapid detox in
      chronic methadone patients. This may also have important ramifications in the
      treatment of both opiate and alcohol-dependent individuals, especially as a
      relapse prevention tool. It may also be interesting too further test this
      hypothesis with the sublingual combination of the partial opiate mu receptor
      agonist buprenorphrine.

PG  - 397-406
AB  - We conducted a 2-arm randomized trial to test the efficacy of self-help materials
      with or without proactive telephone counseling to increase cessation among teen
      smokers. Teen smokers (N = 402) recruited from 11 shopping malls and 1 amusement 
      park in the southeastern United States were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: written 
      self-help material plus video; or written self-help material, video, and
      telephone counseling. Cessation rates based on 7-day point-prevalent abstinence
      for the self-help and counseling arms were 11% and 16%, respectively (p = .25),
      at 4 months postbaseline and 19% and 21%, respectively (p = .80), at 8 months
      postbaseline. Sustained abstinence, reflecting 7-day abstinence at both time
      points, in the self-help and counseling arms was 7% and 9% (p = .59). Results
      suggest that minimal self-help cessation approaches that target youth have
      comparable success to that shown among adult smokers. However, refinements in
      telephone-counseling approaches may be needed to achieve the success observed in 
      adult populations.

TI  - Smoking cessation counseling for pregnant women who smoke: scientific basis for
      practice for AWHONN's SUCCESS project.
PG  - 298-305
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To review the literature addressing smoking cessation in pregnant
      women. To develop the project protocol for the Association of Women's Health,
      Obstetric and Neonatal Nurse's (AWHONN) 6th research-based practice project
      titled "Setting Universal Cessation Counseling, Education and Screening Standards
      (SUCCESS): Nursing Care of Pregnant Women Who Smoke." To evaluate the potential
      of systematic integration of this protocol in primary care settings in which
      women seek care at the preconception, pregnant, or postpartum stages. LITERATURE 
      SOURCES: Computerized searches in MEDLINE and CINAHL, as well as references cited
      in articles reviewed. Key concepts in the searches included low-birth-weight
      infants and effects of prenatal smoking on the infant and the effects of
      preconception and prenatal smoking cessation intervention on premature labor and 
      birth weight. LITERATURE SELECTION: Comprehensive articles, reports, and
      guidelines relevant to key concepts and published after 1964 with an emphasis on 
      new findings from 1996 through 2002. Ninety-eight citations were identified as
      useful to this review. LITERATURE SYNTHESIS: Tobacco use among pregnant women and
      children's exposure to tobacco use (secondhand smoke) are associated with
      pregnancy complications such as placental dysfunction (including previa or
      abruption), preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes, spontaneous abortions,
      and decreased birth weight and infant stature. Neonates and children who are
      exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for developing otitis media,
      asthma, other respiratory disorders later in childhood; dying from sudden infant 
      death syndrome; and learning disorders. The "5 A's" intervention and use of
      descriptive statements for smoking status assessment were synthesized into the
      SUCCESS project protocol for AWHONN's 6th research-based practice project.
      CONCLUSIONS: The literature review generated evidence that brief, office-based
      assessment, client-specific tobacco counseling, skill development, and support
      programs serve as an effective practice guideline for clinicians. Implementation 
      and evaluation of the guideline is under way at a total of 13 sites in the United
      States and Canada.

TI  - Abstinence rates and predictors of outcome for smoking cessation: do Brazilian
      smokers need special strategies?
PG  - 778-84
AB  - AIMS: To study tobacco abstinence and risk factors for failure in smoking
      cessation program and to evaluate the need for special strategies in a Brazilian 
      cohort of smokers. DESIGN: A non-randomized, prospective, open clinical trial.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied smokers who attended the Smoking Cessation
      Clinics of Hospital Sao Lucas da PUCRS, in Porto Alegre, Brazil between July,
      1999 and June, 2003. All participated in the same behavioral therapy program and,
      according to the Fagerstrom test, also received nicotine patches and/or
      bupropion. Sustained abstinence was confirmed by exhaled CO measurements </= 10
      parts per million (p.p.m.). Quit rates were evaluated at 12 months. The study
      included 381 patients (62% women, mean age +/- SD 47.4 +/- 11.5 years). FINDINGS:
      Smokers treated with only counseling, counseling + NRT, counseling + bupropion,
      and counseling + bupropion + NRT had an abstinence rates at the end of 12 months 
      of 14.5%, 25.4%, 22.8% and 38.5%, respectively (P < 0.001). The estimated success
      rate was 23.2% at 12 months. The likelihood of failure in smoking cessation at
      the end of 12 months increased with higher nicotine dependence (HR: 1.63; 95% CI:
      1.13-2.35; P = 0.009). Failure occurred significantly less in those patients
      treated with counseling + NRT + bupropion (HR: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.24-0.63 P <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The higher percentage of smoking cessation was achieved
      using multiple therapies (counseling + NRT + bupropion). The only significant
      predictor of failure detected was severe nicotine dependence.

TI  - [Bupropion SR for weaning from smoking in relapsed smokers: results of an open
      multicentre trial in Germany].
PG  - 140-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: After initially successful smoking cessation the majority of patients
      relapse which stresses the addiction character of nicotine dependence. The
      patient and the physician, in therapeutic nihilism will not make another attempt 
      for smoking cessation. In two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials
      in the US and Canada relapsed smokers, who had initially successfully quit
      smoking under Bupropion SR (Zyban), were again treated with Bupropion SR for
      smoking cessation. The encouraging results prompted us to perform a study in
      Germany under the conditions and temporal restraints of a routine medical
      practice. METHODS/PATIENTS: In this open multicentre study 321 patients of a
      total of 365 patients at 62 study sites were included. The patients represented a
      healthy population (= free of severe chronic disease) of smokers, who had
      relapsed after a smoking cessation attempt with Bupropion SR or nicotine
      replacement therapy and were currently smoking at least 20 cig./d for > 3 months.
      The treatment with Bupropion SR (300 mg/d) lasted 7 weeks, with initial run-in of
      150 mg/d for the first three days; motivational counselling was provided during 4
      clinical visits within the study duration of 26 weeks. RESULTS: 55.4 % of the
      patients were heavily or very heavily nicotine dependent as detected by the
      Fagerstrom Tolerance Questionnaire (score 6 - 11). The continuous abstinence
      rates for week 4 - 7 were 29.6 % (ITT) the point prevalence rates for week 26
      were 30.5 % (ITT). Patients who showed a relapse had less daily cigarette
      consumption even after 26 weeks (10.3 cig./d versus 26.9 cig./d pretreatment).
      Nicotine craving reached a low plateau not earlier than week 6. Bupropion SR was 
      well tolerated, only 9.7 % of the patients (ITT) withdrew from the study due to
      an adverse event. The most frequent adverse events were pain of the
      musculoskeletal system and insomnia. CONCLUSIONS: Bupropion SR was effective and 
      well tolerated when given as an aid in smoking cessation in relapsed smokers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the design of the Primary Care Research in Substance Abuse
      and Mental Health for Elderly (PRISM-E) study and baseline characteristics of the
      randomized primary care patients with mental health problems and at-risk alcohol 
      use. METHOD: Adults aged 65 and older were screened at primary care clinics from 
      10 study sites throughout the United States. Those diagnosed for depression,
      anxiety, and/or at-risk alcohol consumption were randomized to either integrated 
      or enhanced referral care. RESULTS: Of the 23,828 participants, 14% had a
      positive assessment for depressive and/or anxiety disorders, and 6% had at-risk
      alcohol consumption diagnoses. Among patients with mental health diagnoses, there
      was a higher preponderance of younger ages, women, and ethnic minorities. Among
      patients with at-risk drinking, there was a higher preponderance of younger ages,
      Whites, and men. DISCUSSION: These findings indicate the need for screening in
      primary care and for engaging older adults in treatment.

TI  - A meta-analysis of the effect of mediated health communication campaigns on
      behavior change in the United States.
PG  - 71-96
AB  - A meta-analysis was performed of studies of mediated health campaigns in the
      United States in order to examine the effects of the campaigns on behavior
      change. Mediated health campaigns have small measurable effects in the
      short-term. Campaign effect sizes varied by the type of behavior: r=.15 for seat 
      belt use, r=.13 for oral health, r=.09 for alcohol use reduction, r=.05 for heart
      disease prevention, r=.05 for smoking, r=.04 for mammography and cervical cancer 
      screening, and r=.04 for sexual behaviors. Campaigns with an enforcement
      component were more effective than those without. To predict campaign effect
      sizes for topics other than those listed above, researchers can take into account
      whether the behavior in a cessation campaign was addictive, and whether the
      campaign promoted the commencement of a new behavior, versus cessation of an old 
      behavior, or prevention of a new undesirable behavior. Given the small campaign
      effect sizes, campaign planners should set modest goals for future campaigns. The
      results can also be useful to evaluators as a benchmark for campaign effects and 
      to help estimate necessary sample size.

TI  - NIH Consensus Statement on Management of Hepatitis C: 2002.
PG  - 1-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide health care providers, patients, and the general public
      with a responsible assessment of currently available data regarding the
      management and treatment of hepatitis C. PARTICIPANTS: A non-Federal,
      nonadvocate, 12-member panel representing the fields of infectious diseases,
      gastroenterology, medical oncology, molecular genetics, geriatrics, internal
      medicine, and the public. In addition, experts in these same fields presented
      data to the panel and to a conference audience of approximately 300. EVIDENCE:
      Presentations by experts; a systematic review of the medical literature provided 
      by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; and an extensive bibliography 
      of hepatitis C research papers, prepared by the National Library of Medicine.
      Scientific evidence was given precedence over clinical anecdotal experience.
      CONFERENCE PROCESS: Answering predefined questions, the panel drafted a statement
      based on the scientific evidence presented in open forum and the scientific
      literature. The draft statement was read in its entirety on the final day of the 
      conference and circulated to the experts and the audience for comment. The panel 
      then met in executive session to consider these comments and released a revised
      statement at the end of the conference. The statement was made available on the
      World Wide Web at http://consensus.nih.gov immediately after the conference. This
      statement is an independent report of the panel and is not a policy statement of 
      the NIH or the Federal Government. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of newly acquired
      hepatitis C infection has diminished in the United States. This decline is
      largely due to a decrease in cases among IDUs for reasons that are unclear and,
      to a lesser extent, to testing of blood donors for HCV. The virus is transmitted 
      by blood and such transmission now occurs primarily through injection drug use,
      sex with an infected partner or multiple partners, and occupational exposure. The
      majority of infections become chronic, and therefore the prevalence of HCV
      infections is high, with about 3 million Americans now estimated to be
      chronically infected. HCV is a leading cause of cirrhosis, a common cause of HCC 
      and the leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States. The disease 
      spectrum associated with HCV infection varies greatly. Various studies have
      suggested that 3 to 20 percent of chronically infected patients will develop
      cirrhosis over a 20-year period, and these patients are at risk for HCC. Persons 
      who are older at the time of infection, patients with continuous exposure to
      alcohol, and those co-infected with HIV or HBV demonstrate accelerated
      progression to more advanced liver disease. Conversely, individuals infected at a
      younger age have little or no disease progression over several decades. The
      diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection is often suggested by abnormalities in
      ALT levels and is established by EIA followed by confirmatory determination of
      HCV RNA. Several sensitive and specific assays are now partly automated for the
      purposes of detecting HCV RNA and quantifying the viral level. Although there is 
      little correlation between viral level and disease manifestations, these assays
      have proven useful in identifying those patients who are more likely to benefit
      from treatment and, particularly, in demonstrating successful response to
      treatment as defined by an SVR. Liver biopsy is useful in defining baseline
      abnormalities of liver disease and in enabling patients and healthcare providers 
      to reach a decision regarding antiviral therapy. Noninvasive tests do not
      currently provide the information that can be obtained through liver biopsy.
      Information on the genotype of the virus is important to guide treatment
      decisions. Genotype 1, most commonly found in the United States, is less amenable
      to treatment than genotypes 2 or 3. Therefore, clinical trials of antiviral
      therapies require genotyping information for appropriate stratification of
      subjects. Recent therapeutic trials in defined, selected populations have clearly
      shown that combinations of interferons and ribavirin are more effective than
      monotherapy. Moreover, trials using pegylated interferons have yielded improved
      SVR rates with similar toxicity profiles. However, results continue to show that 
      the SVR rate is less common in patients with genotype 1 infections, higher HCV
      RNA levels, or more advanced stages of fibrosis. Genotype 1 infections require
      therapy for 48 weeks, whereas shorter treatment is feasible in genotype 2 and 3
      infections. In genotype 1, the lack of an early virologic response (< 2 log
      decrease in HCV RNA) is associated with failure to achieve an SVR. The SVR is
      lower in patients with advanced liver disease than in patients without cirrhosis.
      Ongoing trials are exploring the usefulness of combination therapy in various
      populations. Preliminary experience in IDUs, individuals co-infected with HIV,
      children, and other special groups suggests similar responses are achievable in
      these populations. Patients with acute hepatitis C may be treated, but specific
      recommendations for antiviral treatment must await further evaluation of the rate
      of spontaneous clearance of the virus and determination of the optimal time to
      initiate treatment. Preventive measures beyond blood-banking practices include
      prompt identification of infected individuals, awareness of the potential for
      perinatal transmission, implementation of safe-injection practices, linkage of
      drug users to drug treatment programs, and implementation of community-based
      education and support programs to modify risk behavior. Some of these measures
      have been successfully implemented in the control of HIV infections, and it
      stands to reason that they would be valuable for reducing HCV transmission.
      Future advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatitis C require continued 
      vigilance concerning the transmission of this infection, extending treatment to
      populations not previously evaluated in treatment trials, and the introduction of
      more effective therapies.

TI  - Successful treatment with a nicotine lozenge of smokers with prior failure in
      pharmacological therapy.
PG  - 83-92
AB  - AIMS: To assess the influence of unsuccessful past quit attempts using
      pharmacological treatment on smoking cessation when using a new nicotine lozenge.
      DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Fifteen
      sites in the United Kingdom and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1818 
      smokers seeking smoking cessation treatment; 1145 had had previous
      pharmacological treatment for smoking cessation. INTERVENTION: Lozenge, 2 mg or 4
      mg (or matched placebo); a higher dose was assigned to smokers who smoked their
      first cigarette of the day within 30 minutes, a sign of dependence. Smokers
      received minimal instruction and counseling. MEASUREMENT: Outcome was 28-day,
      CO-verified continuous abstinence at 6 weeks. Past use of medications was
      ascertained by self-report. FINDINGS: Lozenge was efficacious among smokers with 
      prior pharmacotherapy as well as among those without such history. The effect of 
      lozenge (versus placebo) was significantly greater among those with previous
      treatment experience, because previous treatment was associated with
      significantly poorer outcome on placebo, and active lozenge treatment corrected
      this imbalance. Lozenge efficacy was similar whether smokers had previously tried
      patch or acute forms of nicotine replacement therapy (gum, inhaler and spray),
      and also similar for past use of Zyban (bupriopion). CONCLUSIONS: Smokers with a 
      history of past failure of pharmacological treatment have lower success rates
      without pharmacological treatment, but equally good outcomes with active lozenge 
      treatment. Smokers who previously tried pharmacological treatments but resumed
      smoking should be encouraged to try quitting again with the new nicotine lozenge.

TI  - European Union policy on smokeless tobacco: a statement in favour of evidence
      based regulation for public health.
PG  - 360-7
AB  - RATIONALE: This statement is an updated version of one released by the same
      authors in February 2003. The statement was produced to follow up the Royal
      College of Physicians (RCP) Tobacco Advisory Group report "Protecting smokers,
      saving lives: the case for a tobacco and nicotine regulatory authority", which
      argued for an evidence based regulatory approach to smokeless tobacco and harm
      reduction and posed a series of questions that regulators must address in
      relation to smokeless tobacco. The purpose of this statement is to provide
      arguments of fact and principle to follow the RCP's report and to outline the
      public health case for changing existing European Union (EU) regulation in this
      area. A review of regulation in relation to harm reduction and regulation of
      tobacco products other than cigarettes is required in Article 11 of EU directive 
      2001/37/EC, and this is a contribution towards forming a consensus in the
      European public health community about what policy the EU should adopt in the
      light of this review, or following ongoing legal action that may potentially
      strike out the existing regulation altogether. PUBLIC HEALTH CASE: We believe
      that the partial ban applied to some forms of smokeless tobacco in the EU should 
      be replaced by regulation of the toxicity of all smokeless tobacco. We hold this 
      view for public health reasons: smokeless tobacco is substantially less harmful
      than smoking and evidence from Sweden suggests it is used as a substitute for
      smoking and for smoking cessation. To the extent there is a "gateway" it appears 
      not to lead to smoking, but away from it and is an important reason why Sweden
      has the lowest rates of tobacco related disease in Europe. We think it is wrong
      to deny other Europeans this option for risk reduction and that the current ban
      violates rights of smokers to control their own risks. For smokers that are
      addicted to nicotine and cannot or will not stop, it is important that they can
      take advantage of much less hazardous forms of nicotine and tobacco-the
      alternative being to "quit or die". and many die. While nicotine replacement
      therapies (NRT) may have a role in harm reduction, tobacco based harm reduction
      options may reach more smokers and in a different, market based, way. Chewing
      tobacco is not banned or regulated in the EU but is often highly toxic, and our
      proposal could remove more products from the market than it permitted. REGULATORY
      OPTIONS: We believe that the EU policy on smokeless tobacco should adapt to new
      scientific knowledge and that the European Commission should bring forward
      proposals to amend or replace Article 8 of directive 2001/37/EC with a new
      regulatory framework. Canada has developed testing regimens for tobacco
      constituents and these could be readily adapted to the European situation. A
      review of EU policy in this area is required no later than December 2004, and we 
      believe the Commission should expedite the part of its review that deals with
      harm reduction and regulation of tobacco products other than cigarettes so as to 
      reconsider its policy on smokeless tobacco. We held this view before Swedish
      Match brought its legal proceedings to challenge EU legislation and we will
      continue to hold these views if its action fails.

TI  - Implementing evidence-based practice: reducing risk for low birth weight through 
      pregnancy smoking cessation.
PG  - 676-82
AB  - In 1989, the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses
      (AWHONN) developed a research utilization program to integrate evidence into
      practice areas where there were large discrepancies between research evidence and
      clinical practice. The current program, renamed Research-Based Practice (RBP),
      uses translational research methods to build from evidence such as that in the
      Cochrane database and to create protocols for integration of research directly
      into clinical practice. This article describes the development of the sixth
      project (RBP6), in which an evidence-based protocol to address smoking in
      pregnancy was integrated into clinical practice. The protocol includes screening 
      women using descriptive statements and integrates the 5 As (ask, advise, assess, 
      assist, arrange) into prenatal and postpartum care at every visit. By integrating
      smoking cessation counseling into care, nurses may reduce the risk of low birth
      weight among pregnant women in both the United States and Canada.

TI  - Characteristics of highly physically active smokers in a population of young
      adult military recruits.
PG  - 1405-18
AB  - A substantial number of cigarette smokers are thought to engage in regular
      exercise. It is unclear why individuals who engage in a health-promoting activity
      such as exercising would simultaneously engage in a health-damaging behavior like
      smoking. Two possibilities are that (1) exercise serves as a "harm reduction"
      strategy to lessen the negative effects of smoking, or (2) that among weight
      conscious individuals, exercise and smoking are both used as weight control
      strategies. To examine these issues, smoking status, physical activity level,
      weight concerns, and several additional health behaviors and attitudes were
      assessed by questionnaire in a population of United States Air Force recruits
      (n=32,144). Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to compare
      characteristics of highly physically active smokers with both highly physically
      active never-smokers, and less active smokers. A substantial proportion of
      smokers reported being highly physically active (15.8%), although this proportion
      was significantly higher for never-smokers (22.7%). Active smokers were similar
      to active never-smokers across several health behaviors and attitudes, including 
      diet, seatbelt use, and attitudes toward illegal drugs and condom use. Compared
      to less active smokers, active smokers consumed more fruits and vegetables,
      worried less about their weight, were less nicotine dependent, and had greater
      previous success at quitting smoking. These findings indicate that a substantial 
      proportion of highly physically active young adults are regular cigarette
      smokers. Based on findings regarding general health behaviors and smoking
      history, this group may be particularly amenable to smoking cessation efforts.

TI  - Canadian Thoracic Society recommendations for management of chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease--2003.
PG  - 11A-65A
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common cause of disability and 
      death in Canada. Moreover, morbidity and mortality from COPD continue to rise,
      and the economic burden is enormous. The main goal of the Canadian Thoracic
      Society (CTS) Evidence-Based Guidelines is to optimize early diagnosis,
      prevention and management of COPD in Canada. Targeted spirometry is strongly
      recommended to expedite early diagnosis in smokers and exsmokers who develop
      respiratory symptoms, and who are at risk for COPD. Smoking cessation remains the
      single most effective intervention in accordance with the increasing severity of 
      symptoms and disability. Long-acting anticholinergics and beta2-agonist inhalers 
      should be prescribed for patients who remain symptomatic despite short-acting
      bronchodilatory therapy. Inhaled steroids should not be used as first-line
      therapy in COPD but have a role in preventing exacerbations in patients with more
      advanced disease who suffer recurrent exacerbations. Management strategies
      consisting of combined modern pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacotherapeutic
      interventions (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation/exercise training) can effectively
      improve symptoms, activity levels and quality of life, even in patients with
      severe COPD. Acute exacerbations of COPD cause significant morbidity and
      mortality and should be treated promptly with bronchodilators and a short course 
      of oral steroids; antibiotics should be prescribed for purulent exacerbations.
      Patients with advanced COPD and respiratory failure require a comprehensive
      management plan that incorporates structured end-of-life care.

TI  - Risk factors for corneal infiltrative events with 30-night continuous wear of
      silicone hydrogel lenses.
PG  - S153-6; discussion S166, S192-4
AB  - PURPOSE: This analysis reports on risk factors for corneal infiltrative events
      from a 1-year, randomized clinical trial of lotrafilcon A lenses. METHODS: Six
      hundred fifty-eight subjects randomized to lotrafilcon A lenses were observed in 
      a 1-year clinical trial in the United States. Risk factors gathered at baseline
      were analyzed to determine their association with corneal infiltrative events.
      RESULTS: Factors examined but not found to be associated with events were male
      sex, history of extended or daily lens wear, refractive error,
      neovascularization, or assessment of lens fit. Significant factors included
      subject age 18 to 29 years, smoking, smoking and young age combined, history of
      corneal scar, contact lens acute red eye (CLARE), and corneal infiltrates.
      CONCLUSION: Risk factors for corneal infiltrative events with silicone hydrogel
      lenses worn for 30 nights of continuous wear have been identified. Wearers with a
      history of inflammatory events such as contact lens peripheral ulcer or CLARE
      should consider 30-night continuous wear with these lenses. Careful counseling of
      wearers who smoke is advised.

TI  - Technical results and effects of operator experience on uterine artery
      embolization for fibroids: the Ontario Uterine Fibroid Embolization Trial.
PG  - 545-54
AB  - PURPOSE: To document the technical results and spectrum of practice of uterine
      artery embolization (UAE) for fibroids in the health care setting in Canada. The 
      effects of interventional radiologist's (IR's) experience with UAE on procedure
      and fluoroscopy time were also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study
      involved a multicenter prospective single-arm clinical treatment trial and
      included the practices of 11 IRs at eight university-affiliated teaching and
      community hospitals. Vascular access with percutaneous femoral artery approach
      was followed by transcatheter delivery of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) particles into 
      uterine arteries with fluoroscopic guidance. Technical success, complications,
      procedural time, fluoroscopy time, and effects of operator experience were
      outcomes analyzed. RESULTS: Between November 1998 and November 2000, 570
      embolization procedures were performed in 555 patients. UAE was bilaterally
      successful in 97% (95% CI: 95%-98%). Variant anatomy was the most common reason
      for failure to embolize bilaterally. The procedural complication rate was 5.3%
      (95% CI: 3.6%-7.4%). Of the 30 events, three involved major complications (one
      seizure and two allergic reactions) that resulted in additional care or extended 
      hospital stay. Procedure time and fluoroscopy time averaged 61 minutes (95% CI;
      58-63 minutes) and 18.9 minutes (95% CI; 18-19.8) and varied significantly among 
      IRs (P <.001; P <.001). The average 27% reduction in procedure time (20 minutes; 
      P <.001) and 24% reduction in fluoroscopy time (5.1 minutes; P <.001) with
      increasing UAE experience were significant. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of
      technical success with few complications was obtained with a variety of operators
      in diverse practice settings. Increased experience in UAE significantly reduced
      procedure and fluoroscopy time.

TI  - Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: summary of an AASLD Single Topic Conference.
PG  - 1202-19
AB  - Fatty liver disease that develops in the absence of alcohol abuse is recognized
      increasingly as a major health burden. This report summarizes the presentations
      and discussions at a Single Topic Conference held September 20-22, 2002, and
      sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The
      conference focused on fatty liver disorders. Estimates based on imaging and
      autopsy studies suggest that about 20% to 30% of adults in the United States and 
      other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the liver. About 10% of
      these individuals, or fully 2% to 3% of adults, are estimated to meet current
      diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained liver
      injury leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in a fraction, possibly up to 
      one third, of those with NASH, and NASH may be a cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. 
      NASH is now a significant health issue for obese children as well, leading to
      cirrhosis in some. The diagnostic criteria for NASH continue to evolve and rely
      on the histologic findings of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning,
      Mallory bodies), and the pattern of fibrosis. Generally recognized indications
      for biopsy include establishing the diagnosis and staging of the injury, but
      strict guidelines do not exist. Liver enzymes are insensitive and cannot be used 
      reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Older age,
      obesity, and diabetes are predictive of fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is
      multifactorial. Insulin resistance may be an important factor in the accumulation
      of hepatocellular fat, whereas excess intracellular fatty acids, oxidant stress, 
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be
      important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver. Efforts are
      underway to refine the role of insulin resistance in NASH and determine whether
      improving insulin sensitivity pharmacologically is an effective treatment. An
      altered lifestyle may be a more effective means of improving insulin sensitivity.
      The research agenda for the future includes establishing the role of insulin
      resistance and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in NASH, determining the
      pathogenesis of cellular injury, defining predisposing genetic abnormalities,
      identifying better noninvasive predictors of disease, and defining effective
      therapy.

      Management of Hepatitis C 2002.
PG  - 261-87
AB  - The incidence of newly acquired hepatitis C infection has diminished in the
      United States. This decline is largely because of a decrease in cases among IDUs 
      for reasons that are unclear and, to a lesser extent, to testing of blood donors 
      for HCV. The virus is transmitted by blood, and such transmission now occurs
      primarily through injection drug use, sex with an infected partner or multiple
      partners, and occupational exposure. Most infections become chronic, and
      therefore the prevalence of HCV infections is high, with about 3 million
      Americans estimated, to be chronically infected. HCV is a leading cause of
      cirrhosis, a common cause of HCC and the leading cause of liter transplantation
      in the United States. The disease spectrum associated with HCV infection varies
      greatly. Various studies have suggested that 3% to 10% of chronically infected
      patients will develop cirrhosis over a 20-year period, and these patients are at 
      risk for HCC. Persons who are older at the time of infection, patients with
      continuous exposure to alcohol, and those coinfected with HIV or HBV demonstrate 
      accelerated progression to more advanced liver disease. Conversely, individuals
      infected at a younger age have little or no disease progression over several
      decades. The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C infection often is suggested by
      abnormalities in ALT levels and is established by EIA followed by confirmatory
      determination of HCV RNA. Several sensitive and specific assays are automated
      partly for the purposes of detecting HCV RNA and quantifying the viral level.
      Although there is little correlation between viral level and disease
      manifestations, these assays have proven useful in identifying those patients who
      are more likely to benefit from treatment and, particularly, in demonstrating
      successful response to treatment as defined by an SVR. Liver biopsy is useful in 
      defining baseline abnormalities of liver disease and in enabling patients and
      healthcare providers to reach a decision regarding antiviral therapy. Noninvasive
      tests do not provide the information that can be obtained through liver biopsy.
      Information on the genotype of the virus is important to guide treatment
      decisions. Genotype 1, most commonly found in the United States, is less amenable
      to treatment than genotypes 2 or 3. Therefore, clinical trials of antiviral
      therapies require genotyping information for appropriate stratification of
      subjects. Recent therapeutic trials in defined, selected populations have shown
      clearly that combinations of interferons and ribavirin are more effective than
      monotherapy. Moreover, trials using pegylated interferons have yielded improved
      SVR rates with similar toxicity profiles. Results continue to show, however, that
      the SVR rate is less common in patients with genotype 1 infections, higher HCV
      RNA levels, or more advanced stages of fibrosis. Genotype 1 infections require
      therapy for 48 weeks, whereas shorter treatment is feasible in genotype 2 and 3
      infections. In genotype 1, the lack of an early virologic response (< 2 log
      decrease in HCV RNA) is associated with failure to achieve an SVR. The SVR is
      lower in patients with advanced liver disease than in patients without cirrhosis.
      Ongoing trials are exploring the usefulness of combination therapy in various
      populations. Preliminary experience in IDUs, individuals coinfected with HIV,
      children, and other special groups suggests similar responses are achievable in
      these populations. Patients with acute hepatitis C may be treated, but specific
      recommendations for antiviral treatment must await further evaluation of the rate
      of spontaneous clearance of the virus and determination of the optimal time to
      initiate treatment. Preventive measures beyond blood-banking practices include
      prompt identification of infected individuals, awareness of the potential for
      perinatal transmission, implementation of safe injection practices, linkage of
      drug users to drug treatment programs. and implementation of community-based
      education and support programs to modify risk behavior. Some of these measures
      have been implemented successfully in the control of HIV infections, and it
      stands to reason that they would be valuable for reducing HCV transmission.
      Future advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatitis C require continued 
      vigilance concerning the transmission of this infection, extending treatment to
      populations not evaluated previously in treatment trials, and the introduction of
      more effective therapies.

TI  - Design of the Genetics of Early Onset Cardiovascular Disease (GENECARD) study.
PG  - 602-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and a
      leading cause of disability in the developed world. Early onset (premature)
      coronary artery disease (EOCAD) is known to have a particularly strong genetic
      component. However, the actual genes leading to this increased risk of CAD remain
      obscure. METHODS: The primary goal of the Genetics of Early Onset Cardiovascular 
      Disease (GENECARD) study is to perform a genetic linkage study in 920 families
      with at least 1 sibling pair having EOCAD. The study sites include a US network
      of 15 cardiology practices and 5 additional sites located in Europe and the
      United States. We propose to identify chromosomal regions associated with
      increased susceptibility to EOCAD in this large sample of affected sibling pairs 
      and nuclear families, where EOCAD is defined on the basis of having acute
      coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), a revascularization
      procedure, or a positive functional imaging study at or before the age of 50
      years in men or 55 years in women. To identify which genomic regions and genes
      are associated with increased susceptibility to EOCAD, we will use a
      comprehensive strategy comprising genomic screening, fine mapping, candidate gene
      analysis, and family-based association studies. RESULTS: Herein we describe the
      clinical characteristics, family history, and risk factor profiles of the 1168
      members from 438 nuclear families included in the first, exploratory analysis.
      Analysis of the study population revealed a strong concordance of known cardiac
      risk factors among affected sibling pairs. There was significant concordance (P
      <. 01) among siblings with EOCAD for presence of diabetes (78% concordance),
      dyslipoproteinemia (67%), obesity (63%), and hypertension (56%). This level of
      concordance of risk factors among siblings might be expected, given the
      significant genetic components demonstrated for these metabolic susceptibility
      traits. However, there was also substantial sibling pair concordance (P <.01) for
      smoking history (74%), regular alcohol consumption (81%), and sedentary lifestyle
      (63%), environmental traits without known inherited predisposition. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Analyses such as these will have implications for stratifying populations for the
      statistical analysis of the genome scan and on the choice of covariates for the
      follow-up studies of the initial genome screen analysis.

TI  - What are the criteria by which a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis can be
      made in males and non-Caucasians?
PG  - S19-27
AB  - Osteoporotic fractures are not rare in men or non-Caucasian women. However, for
      these groups, there is no consensus densitometric definition of osteoporosis. As 
      is the case in Caucasian women, low bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with
      increased fracture risk among men and non-Caucasian women; thus, a densitometric 
      definition of osteoporosis seems feasible. Reaching agreement on criteria for
      diagnosing osteoporosis in men and non-Caucasians was among the goals of the
      International Society for Clinical Densitometry Position Development Conference
      held in July 2001. To this end, the conference recommendation for males is that
      osteoporosis be defined as a BMD T-score of -2.5 or below the young normal mean
      for men. Since the relationship between BMD and fracture risk may differ between 
      men and women, it is recommended that T scores in men continue to be derived
      using a male normative database. Similarly, for non-Caucasians, the
      recommendation is to diagnose osteoporosis at or below a T-score of -2.5.
      However, given the difficulty in defining race or ethnic groups, a dearth of
      data, and their conflicting nature correlating BMD with fracture risk in
      different ethnicities, it is recommended that a uniform normative database (not
      adjusted for race) be utilized in the United States for T-score derivation in
      non-Caucasians. Note that these are current clinical recommendations, which may
      change as additional data accumulate. Furthermore, there was agreement that the
      following individuals should have their bone density measured: anyone (male or
      female, regardless of race) with prior fragility fractures or with conditions
      widely recognized to increase the risk of bone loss and fracture (such as
      hypogonadism, corticosteroid treatment, hyperparathyroidism, alcohol abuse,
      anticonvulsant use, and prior gastrectomy); women on long-term hormone
      replacement therapy; and in the absence of these conditions, women age 65 and
      older (regardless of race) and men age 70 and older.

TI  - Position of the American Dietetic Association: the role of dietetics
      professionals in health promotion and disease prevention.
PG  - 1680-7
AB  - In the United States, the leading determinants of morbidity and mortality are
      rooted in behavioral choices related to eating habits, exercise, tobacco, alcohol
      consumption, and stress reduction. Scientific data consistently provide evidence 
      that diet plays an important role in health promotion and disease prevention.
      Healthy eating habits--coupled with other healthful lifestyle behaviors--have the
      potential to reduce the risk of chronic disease. Health care typically assumes a 
      curative or treatment role in the United States. However, dietetics professionals
      are shaping an alternate view of health, which includes developing healthy public
      policies, creating safe and supportive environments, building communities and
      coalitions, and reorienting health services to include health promotion as a
      primary approach to delivering health care. Individual-level approaches, such as 
      counseling and group education, have been employed most often in modifying health
      behaviors. However, population-level approaches that affect availability of or
      access to healthy foods, opportunities for physical activity, and other healthy
      lifestyle determinants also are important. Dietetics professionals have pivotal
      roles in both individual- and population-level approaches.

TI  - Tobacco intervention training: current efforts and gaps in US medical schools.
PG  - 1102-9
AB  - CONTEXT: Research has documented that US medical schools inadequately teach
      tobacco intervention skills. OBJECTIVE: To examine effective training methods for
      tobacco intervention in undergraduate medical education. DATA SOURCES: Using
      indexing terms related to tobacco intervention and medical education, we searched
      MEDLINE (1966-June 2002) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through
      issue 2, 2002). Reference lists of relevant articles were also read to identify
      additional articles. Because of their importance to tobacco intervention, we also
      reviewed Ockene and colleagues' tobacco education research and the tobacco
      treatment guidelines of the United States Public Health Service and the United
      States Preventive Services Task Force. STUDY SELECTION: All study designs that
      incorporated process or outcome evaluation of tobacco intervention educational
      methods for medical students were included in this review. Of an initial 1241
      articles retrieved, 82 included medical students. Reviewing abstracts and
      references of these articles identified 13 pertinent studies. DATA EXTRACTION:
      Quality criteria for inclusion consisted of explicit evaluation of the
      educational methods used. Data extraction identified all evaluations and any
      problems in program implementation. DATA SYNTHESIS: Enhanced instructional
      methods (eg, the use of patient-centered counseling, standardized patient
      instructors, role playing, or a combination of these) are more effective for
      teaching tobacco intervention than are traditional didactic methods alone and can
      be effectively inserted into medical school curricula. CONCLUSIONS: Various
      educational methods have been used to train medical students in tobacco
      intervention. Nonetheless, gaps still exist within undergraduate medical
      education, including a lack of integration of tobacco dependence information
      throughout all 4 years of medical school curricula, specific training in
      smokeless tobacco intervention, tobacco intervention training that addresses
      cultural issues, and long-term studies showing that such training is retained.

TI  - The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST):
      development, reliability and feasibility.
PG  - 1183-94
AB  - AIMS: The Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) was 
      developed for the World Health Organization (WHO) by an international group of
      substance abuse researchers to detect psychoactive substance use and related
      problems in primary care patients. This report describes the new instrument as
      well as a study of its reliability and feasibility. SETTING: The study was
      conducted at participating sites in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, India, Israel,
      the Palestinian Territories, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and Zimbabwe. Sixty 
      per cent of the sample was recruited from alcohol and drug abuse treatment
      facilities; the remainder was drawn from general medical settings and psychiatric
      facilities. METHODS: The study was concerned primarily with test item
      reliability, using a simple test-retest procedure to determine whether subjects
      would respond consistently to the same items when presented in an interview
      format on two different occasions. Qualitative and quantitative data were also
      collected to evaluate the feasibility of the screening items and rating format.
      PARTICIPANTS: A total of 236 volunteer participants completed test and retest
      interviews at nine collaborating sites. Slightly over half of the sample (53.6%) 
      was male. The mean age of the sample was 34 years and they had completed, on
      average, 10 years of education. RESULTS: The average test-retest reliability
      coefficients (kappas) ranged from a high of 0.90 (consistency of reporting 'ever'
      use of substance) to a low of 0.58 (regretted what was done under influence of
      substance). The average kappas for substance classes ranged from 0.61 for
      sedatives to 0.78 for opioids. In general, the reliabilities were in the range of
      good to excellent, with the following items demonstrating the highest kappas
      across all drug classes: use in the last 3 months, preoccupied with drug use,
      concern expressed by others, troubled by problems related to drug use,
      intravenous drug use. Qualitative data collected at the end of the retest
      interview suggested that the questions were not difficult to answer and were
      consistent with patients' expectations for a health interview. The data were used
      to guide the selection of a smaller set of items that can serve as the basis for 
      more extensive validation research. CONCLUSION: The ASSIST items are reliable and
      feasible to use as part of an international screening test. Further evaluation of
      the screening test should be conducted.

TI  - The effect of total body water on the relationship between alcohol consumption
      and carbohydrate-deficient transferrin.
PG  - 1097-104
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinicians agree that alcoholism commonly is overlooked in their
      patients, and that treating the symptoms without directing therapy to the
      underlying cause at best delays an inevitable decline in the patient's general
      health and well-being. The current analysis focused on carbohydrate-deficient
      transferrin (CDT), a promising biological marker of dangerous alcohol
      consumption. METHODS: Included in our study were men (730) and women (613) from
      study sites in Canada, Brazil, and Japan. All subjects were participants in the
      WHO/ISBRA Study on State and Trait Markers of Alcoholism, who completed an
      extensive demographic, medical, and behavioral survey and provided blood samples 
      for determination of CDT levels. ANOVA and chi2 test for equality were used to
      examine the effect of total body water (TBW) on the alcohol consumption/CDT
      relationship. To examine whether accounting for differences in TBW improved the
      diagnostic properties of CDT when used as a state marker for alcohol consumption,
      odds ratios were calculated for men and women separately. RESULTS: Our results
      show that accounting for individual differences in TBW significantly influenced
      the alcohol consumption/CDT dose-response relationship. The effect of TBW was
      different for men compared with women. When we used a consumption cutoff value of
      40 g/day and the CDTect recommended cutoffs (20 for men; 27 for women), adjusting
      for differences in TBW significantly increased diagnostic performance of CDT in
      men but not women. CONCLUSIONS: The dependence of CDT measures on body water
      content needs to be taken into account to maximize the performance of CDT as an
      effective state marker of alcohol consumption in males.

TI  - Percutaneous transluminal septal reduction for hypertrophic obstructive
      cardiomyopathy: report from an international pilot study.
PG  - 293-300
AB  - Assessing the effectiveness of newer treatments for rare diseases can be
      challenging because of the small number of patients treated at individual
      centers. We enrolled patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal septal
      myocardial ablation (PTSMA) for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) at
      five international centers (1 Japan, 2 United Kingdom, and 2 United States). Our 
      study group developed standard data definitions regarding clinical symptom
      severity, previous HOCM treatment, procedure status, and outcome, and entered
      patient data directly into a shared, web-based registry system. In the first 10
      months of 1998, 51 patients were enrolled in our registry, with 47 ultimately
      receiving the PTSMA procedure. Although HOCM is consider a single disease, there 
      were significant differences among centers in patient characteristics (age,
      gender, and family history of HOCM), symptom severity, diagnostic techniques
      (measurements taken after provocation), and treatment (amount of alcohol used,
      timing of injection, and number of branches attempted).

TI  - Preventive care in the emergency department: diagnosis and management of smoking 
      and smoking-related illness in the emergency department: a systematic review.
PG  - 720-9
AB  - Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in the
      United States. The efficacy of emergency department (ED)-based patient screening 
      and counseling for smoking cessation is not currently known. OBJECTIVES: To
      perform a structured, systematic review of the medical literature to assess the
      efficacy of limited screening and counseling for tobacco use cessation among
      adults in the primary care and ED settings, and develop recommendations for
      emergency physicians based on these data. METHODS: A two-person template-driven
      review of all English-language articles from Medline, the Cochrane Database, and 
      two recent smoking cessation guidelines, with evidence graded according to the
      scheme of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), was performed.
      Recommendations were developed, and strength graded, based on this evidence.
      RESULTS: Of 2,078 citations reviewed, 16 were selected for inclusion, based on
      their methodologic strength and relevance to emergency medicine. Routine
      physician screening and counseling may increase quit rates at 6-12 months from 3%
      (usual care) to 8-11%. Interventions include brief counseling (<3 minutes),
      possibly supplemented with self-help literature, nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT), and follow-up telephone calls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists, in the
      primary care setting, that smoking cessation screening and counseling are
      effective. Limited data exist for ED-based practice, but, based on the burden of 
      disease, relative ease of intervention, and likely efficacy, routine screening of
      all patients for tobacco use and referral of smokers to primary care and
      cessation programs are recommended.

TI  - Brief prevention for adolescent risk-taking behavior.
PG  - 563-74
AB  - AIMS: Despite widespread prevention efforts to decrease adolescent risk-taking,
      substance use and driving after drinking (DD) are prevalent in the United States.
      The current study compared the efficacy of an abbreviated version of Drug Abuse
      and Resistance Education (DARE-A) to a new Risk Skills Training Program (RSTP).
      DESIGN: Adolescent participation in drinking, drug use, DD and riding with a
      drunk driver was examined longitudinally. After baseline assessments, adolescents
      were randomly assigned to the RSTP. DARE-A or a no intervention control group and
      then completed 2-month post-test and 6-month follow-up assessments. SETTING:
      Adolescents attended a mid-sized suburban high school. PARTICIPANTS: The sample
      (N = 300) was comprised of 58% females and the age range was 14-19 years.
      INTERVENTION: The RSTP was developed to target several risk behaviors and to
      examine the feasibility of conducting a brief personalized prevention program in 
      a group setting. DARE-A focused on increasing knowledge and understanding the
      deleterious effects of substance use. MEASUREMENTS: Risk-taking behavior,
      perception of peer risk-taking and positive and negative alcohol expectancies
      were assessed. FINDINGS: RSTP participants decreased participation in several
      risk behaviors at post-test, but reductions were not maintained at 6-month
      follow-up. The control and DARE-A groups increased their positive and decreased
      their negative alcohol expectancies. The control group increased their alcohol
      consumption. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that a brief, personalized, group
      prevention program is a feasible approach to reducing adolescent risk-taking.
      Strategies must be developed to solidify these positive changes so that they are 
      longer-lasting.

TI  - Community-acquired pneumonia and do not resuscitate orders.
PG  - 290-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: From a cohort of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) who
      required admission to hospital, to describe the subset of patients having a do
      not resuscitate (DNR) order and to compare them with those who did not have such 
      an order. DESIGN: Retrospective subset analysis of data from the pneumonia
      patient outcomes research team study. SETTING: Three hospitals in the United
      States and one in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Hospitalized patients aged 18 and older
      with CAP. MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic features, severity of illness,
      antibiotic therapy, length of stay, mortality, admission to special care units,
      and mortality attributable to pneumonia. RESULTS: The 199 (14.9) of 1,339
      inpatients with CAP who had a DNR order written within 24 hours of admission and 
      an additional 96 (7.2) patients who had such an order written later were compared
      with the 1,044 who never had a DNR order. The 199 patients with an initial DNR
      and 96 later DNR were older (median age 81 and 78 vs 65 years, respectively; P<
      .001), more likely to be white (92.5 and 90.6 vs 84.8; P = .007), and more likely
      to have come from a nursing home or chronic care facility (53.8 and 31.3 vs 4.5; 
      P< .001). The two DNR groups received more antibiotics for a longer time than the
      never DNR patients. The DNR patients had longer lengths of stay than the never
      DNR patients (medians 9 and 12 vs 7 days). There were 89 in-hospital deaths among
      the 1,339 patients, but only 11 of these were among patients who did not have a
      DNR order during the first 30 days (sensitivity, specificity, and positive and
      negative predictive values of a DNR order for in-hospital mortality were 87.6,
      82.6, 26.4, and 98.9, respectively). The 90-day mortality rates were 43.2 for the
      initial DNR group, 61.5 in the later DNR group, and 4.7 for the never DNR group
      (P< .001). Pneumonia-attributable mortality accounted for most of the in-hospital
      deaths but did not differ by DNR status. Only 31.7 of the initial DNR patients
      and 24.0 of the later DNR patients were discharged home, versus 82.6 of the other
      patients (P< .001). In a multivariate analysis, the following were predictive of 
      initial DNR: age, nursing home care, active cancer, dementia, neuromuscular
      disorders, altered mental status, low systolic blood pressure, tachypnea,
      abnormal hematocrit, abnormal blood urea nitrogen, and absence of alcohol or
      intravenous drug abuse. In similar analyses of DNR at any time, additional
      predictors included aspiration, low white blood count, chronic pulmonary disease,
      cerebrovascular disease, and congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION: Most
      in-hospital pneumonia deaths occur in patients who have a DNR order. DNR orders
      written within 24 hours of admission primarily reflect comorbid status, whereas
      DNR orders written later during hospitalization reflect the futility of care plus
      comorbidity.

TI  - Evaluating primary care behavioral counseling interventions: an evidence-based
      approach.
PG  - 267-84
AB  - Risky behaviors are a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality, yet
      behavioral counseling interventions to address them are underutilized in
      healthcare settings. Research on such interventions has grown steadily, but the
      systematic review of this research is complicated by wide variations in the
      organization, content, and delivery of behavioral interventions and the lack of a
      consistent language and framework to describe these differences. The Counseling
      and Behavioral Interventions Work Group of the United States Preventive Services 
      Task Force (USPSTF) was convened to address adapting existing USPSTF methods to
      issues and challenges raised by behavioral counseling intervention topical
      reviews. The systematic review of behavioral counseling interventions seeks to
      establish whether such interventions addressing individual behaviors improve
      health outcomes. Few studies directly address this question, so evidence
      addressing whether changing individual behavior improves health outcomes and
      whether behavioral counseling interventions in clinical settings help people
      change those behaviors must be linked. To illustrate this process, we present two
      separate analytic frameworks derived from screening topic tools that we developed
      to guide USPSTF behavioral topic reviews. No simple empirically validated model
      captures the broad range of intervention components across risk behaviors, but
      the Five A's construct-assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange-adapted from
      tobacco cessation interventions in clinical care provides a workable framework to
      report behavioral counseling intervention review findings. We illustrate the use 
      of this framework with general findings from recent behavioral counseling
      intervention studies. Readers are referred to the USPSTF
      (www.ahrq.gov/clinic/prevenix.htm or 1-800-358-9295) for systematic evidence
      reviews and USPSTF recommendations based on these reviews for specific behaviors.

TI  - Acupuncture for the treatment of cocaine addiction: a randomized controlled
      trial.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - CONTEXT: Auricular acupuncture is widely used to treat cocaine addiction in the
      United States and Europe. However, evidence from controlled studies regarding
      this treatment's effectiveness has been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To investigate
      the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture as a treatment for cocaine addiction. 
      DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical trial conducted from
      November 1996 to April 1999. SETTING: Six community-based clinics in the United
      States: 3 hospital-affiliated clinics and 3 methadone maintenance programs.
      PATIENTS: Six hundred twenty cocaine-dependent adult patients (mean age, 38.8
      years; 69.2% men); 412 used cocaine only and 208 used both opiates and cocaine
      and were receiving methadone maintenance. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly
      assigned to receive auricular acupuncture (n = 222), a needle-insertion control
      condition (n = 203), or a relaxation control condition (n = 195). Treatments were
      offered 5 times weekly for 8 weeks. Concurrent drug counseling was also offered
      to patients in all conditions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cocaine use during
      treatment and at the 3- and 6-month postrandomization follow-up based on urine
      toxicology screens; retention in treatment. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analysis of 
      urine samples showed a significant overall reduction in cocaine use (odds ratio, 
      1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.74; P =.002) but no differences by
      treatment condition (P =.90 for acupuncture vs both control conditions). There
      were also no differences between the conditions in treatment retention (44%-46%
      for the full 8 weeks). Counseling sessions in all 3 conditions were poorly
      attended. CONCLUSIONS: Within the clinical context of this study, acupuncture was
      not more effective than a needle insertion or relaxation control in reducing
      cocaine use. Our study does not support the use of acupuncture as a stand-alone
      treatment for cocaine addiction or in contexts in which patients receive only
      minimal concurrent psychosocial treatment. Research will be needed to examine
      acupuncture's contribution to addiction treatment when provided in an ancillary
      role.

TI  - Efficacy of naltrexone and acamprosate for alcoholism treatment: a meta-analysis.
PG  - 1335-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Renewed interest in medications to prevent relapse in alcoholics
      (i.e., antidipsotropics) resulted in approval by the Food and Drug Administration
      of naltrexone to treat alcohol dependence. Acamprosate, although not approved in 
      the United States, is used in alcoholism treatment in many other parts of the
      world. In the absence of studies that compare the effects of these medications,
      we used a meta-analytic approach to the literature to compare their efficacy in
      alcoholism treatment. METHODS: All published placebo-controlled trials of
      naltrexone or acamprosate for alcohol dependence were examined, and, when
      suitable, data were extracted for calculation of a mean effect size. A sample of 
      studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment of major
      depression conducted over the last two decades served as a comparator for the
      antidipsotropics. RESULTS: Both antidipsotropics exerted significant, but modest,
      effects on treatment retention and/or drinking outcomes. There was significant
      variability among the studies for the measure on which the largest effect was
      exerted by each of these medications. Based on limited comparisons of the two
      medications, there appears to be no statistical difference in their efficacy in
      the treatment of alcohol dependence. In contrast, there was a consistent effect
      of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on depressive symptoms in major
      depression, which was significantly greater than the effects observed for the
      antidipsotropics. CONCLUSIONS: Both naltrexone and acamprosate are efficacious in
      reducing alcohol consumption in alcoholics. However, their specific role in
      alcoholism treatment remains to be more clearly defined. New approaches to the
      use of these medications and development of new medications are needed if
      pharmacotherapy is to play a substantial role in the treatment of alcoholism.

TI  - Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among at-risk
      women, young sex workers, and street youth attending community organizations in
      Quebec City, Canada.
PG  - 437-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a relatively recent decline in the global incidence of
      Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae it seems that some segments of
      the population such as street youth, sex workers, and individuals with social
      problems or delinquent behavior could be part of a core group for STDs. These
      persons may be reluctant to undergo STD diagnosis in traditional medical
      settings. GOALS: To determine the prevalence of C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae
      infection using polymerase chain reaction on urine samples among subjects
      attending an anonymous HIV testing clinic and four community organizations in
      Quebec City, and to identify associated risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: A
      cross-sectional study of 626 street youth, sex workers, and women with social
      problems or delinquent behavior was conducted. RESULTS: The prevalences of N
      gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis were, respectively, 1.1% (95% CI, 0.5%--2.3%) and
      5.8% (95% CI, 4.1%--7.9%). No significant difference was found between men and
      women, but the sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence was much higher in
      subjects younger than 20 years: 11.4% versus 3.6% (P < 0.01). In a logistic
      regression model, factors independently associated with STD infection were age
      younger than 20 years (OR, 2.6; P = 0.007), occasional sex partners (OR, 2.9; P =
      0.007), and injection of drugs (OR, 2.8; P = 0.002) in the preceding 6 months.
      CONCLUSIONS: A moderate STD prevalence was found in the study population. The
      prevalence, however, can be considered high (>10%) among street youth and young
      sex workers. Providing community-based STD screening and treatment services
      appear to be an efficient method for reaching these high-risk groups.

TI  - A randomized trial to reduce passive smoke exposure in low-income households with
      young children.
PG  - 18-24
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Passive smoke exposure among children is widespread in the United
      States; estimates suggest that almost 40% of children who are younger than 5
      years live with a smoker. Few randomized studies of passive smoke exposure
      reduction among children have been conducted, and the impact of interventions
      that have been evaluated has been limited. The objective of this study was to
      determine whether a motivational intervention for smoking parents of young
      children will lead to reduced household passive smoke exposure. METHODS: Project 
      KISS (Keeping Infants Safe From Smoke), a theory-driven exposure reduction
      intervention targeting low-income families with young children, was a randomized 
      controlled study in which participants-smoking parents/caregivers (N = 291) who
      had children who were younger than 3 years and who were recruited through primary
      care settings-were randomly assigned to either the motivational intervention (MI)
      or a self-help (SH) comparison condition was used. Follow-up assessments were
      conducted at 3 and 6 months. The MI condition consisted of a 30- to 45-minute
      motivational interviewing session at the participant's home with a trained health
      educator and 4 follow-up telephone counseling calls. Feedback from baseline
      household air nicotine assessments and assessment of the participant's carbon
      monoxide level was provided as part of the intervention. Participants in the SH
      group received a copy of the smoking cessation manual, the passive smoke
      reduction tip sheet, and the resource guide in the mail. Household nicotine
      levels were measured by a passive diffusion monitor. RESULTS: The 6-month
      nicotine levels were significantly lower in MI households. Repeated measures
      analysis of variance across baseline, 3-month, and 6-month time points showed a
      significant time-by-treatment interaction, whereby nicotine levels for the MI
      group decreased significantly and nicotine levels for the SH group increased but 
      were not significantly different from baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This study targeted 
      a large sample of racially and ethnically diverse low-income families, in whom
      both exposure and disease burden is likely to be significant. This is the first
      study to our knowledge that has been effective in reducing objective measures of 
      passive smoke exposure in households with healthy children. These findings have
      important implications for pediatric health care providers, who play an important
      role in working with parents to protect children's health. Providers can help
      parents work toward reducing household passive smoke exposure using motivational 
      strategies and providing a menu of approaches regardless of whether the parents
      are ready to quit.

TI  - Collection of genomic DNA from adults in epidemiological studies by buccal
      cytobrush and mouthwash.
PG  - 687-96
AB  - Blood samples are an excellent source of large amounts of genomic DNA. However,
      alternative sources are often needed in epidemiological studies because of
      difficulties in obtaining blood samples. This report evaluates the buccal
      cytobrush and alcohol-containing mouthwash protocols for collecting DNA by mail. 
      Several DNA extraction techniques are also evaluated. The study was conducted in 
      two phases. In phase 1, we compared cytobrush and mouthwash samples collected by 
      mail in two different epidemiological studies: (a) cytobrush samples (n = 120)
      from a United States case-control study of breast cancer; and (b) mouthwash
      samples (n = 40) from a prospective cohort of male United States farmers.
      Findings from phase 1 were confirmed in phase 2, where we randomized cytobrush (n
      = 28) and mouthwash (n = 25) samples among participants in the breast cancer
      study to directly compare both collection methods. The median human DNA yield
      determined by hybridization with a human DNA probe from phenol-chloroform
      extracts was 1.0 and 1.6 microg/2 brushes for phases 1 and 2, respectively, and
      27.5 and 16.6 microg/mouthwash sample for phases 1 and 2, respectively. Most
      (94-100%) mouthwash extracts contained high molecular weight DNA (>23 kb), in
      contrast to 55-61% of the brush extracts. PCR success rates for amplification of 
      beta-globin gene fragments (268, 536, and 989 bp) were similar for cytobrush and 
      mouthwash phenol-chloroform extracts (range, 94.4-100%). Also, we obtained high
      success rates in determining the number of CAG repeats in the androgen receptor
      gene, characterizing tetranucleotide microsatellites in six gene loci, and
      screening for mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes in a subset of phenol-chloroform DNA
      extracts. Relative to DNA extracted by phenol-chloroform from cytobrush samples, 
      DNA extracted by NaOH had lower molecular weight, decreased PCR success rates for
      most assays performed, and unreliably high spectrophotometer readings for DNA
      yields. In conclusion, although DNA isolated from either mouthwash or cytobrush
      samples collected by mail from adults is adequate for a wide range of PCR-based
      assays, a single mouthwash sample provides substantially larger amounts and
      higher molecular weight DNA than two cytobrush samples.

TI  - Bupropion for smoking cessation : predictors of successful outcome.
PG  - 1357-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify predictors of smoking abstinence at the end of medication
      use that could assist in the optimal use of a sustained-release (SR) form of
      bupropion for treating cigarette smokers. DESIGN: A double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, dose-response trial. SETTING: Multicenter (three sites) study
      conducted in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred fifteen healthy men and
      women (> or = 18 years of age) who were smoking > or = 15 cigarettes per day and 
      who were motivated to stop smoking. INTERVENTION: Random assignment of patients
      to placebo or SR bupropion treatment, 100, 150, or 300 mg/d, for 7 weeks (total
      duration of study was 52 weeks: 7 weeks of treatment and 45 weeks of follow-up). 
      MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of 
      abstinence at the end of the medication phase. Univariate predictors included the
      following: bupropion dose (p < 0.001); older age (p = 0.024); lower number of
      cigarettes smoked per day (cpd) (p < 0.001); lower Fagerstrom Tolerance
      Questionnaire score (p = 0.011); longest time previously abstinent that was < 24 
      h or > 4 weeks (p < 0.001); absence of other smokers in the household (p =
      0.021); greater number of previous stop attempts (p = 0.019); and study site (p =
      0.004). Multivariate predictors of abstinence at the end of the medication phase 
      were the following: higher bupropion dose (p < 0.001); lower number of cpd (p <
      0.001); longest time previously abstinent from smoking (p = 0.002); male gender
      (p = 0.014); and study site (p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: Bupropion SR therapy was
      effective in treating cigarette smokers independently of all other
      characteristics studied. Lower smoking rate, brief periods (ie, < 24 h) or long
      periods (ie, > 4 weeks) of abstinence with previous attempts to stop smoking, and
      male gender were predictive of better outcomes, independent of the dose of
      bupropion that was used.

TI  - Tobacco cessation through dental office settings.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - There is increasing interest in broadly inclusive public health interventions
      that involve low-cost, self-help materials and minimal support from
      professionals. Dental health care workers (DHCWs) are a largely untapped resource
      for providing advice and brief counseling to tobacco-using patients, and there
      are good reasons to believe that they can be effective in this role. The results 
      of our randomized clinical trials have shown that a brief dental office-based
      intervention can be effective in helping smokeless tobacco users to quit and
      smokers to reduce their use and become more ready to quit. A third clinical trial
      tested the effectiveness of two methods of disseminating the smokeless tobacco
      intervention to DHCWs throughout the western United States. Workshops were more
      effective than self-study in effecting behavior change, although our analyses
      indicate that self-study was more cost-efficient. These studies have demonstrated
      the viability of using dentists and dental hygienists to provide brief cessation 
      advice and supportive materials in the context of regular oral health visits to
      encourage their patients to quit. The results of these studies also support the
      timeliness of further dissemination and diffusion of this program to
      practitioners, dental schools, and dental hygiene programs.

TI  - The influence of a family program on adolescent tobacco and alcohol use.
PG  - 604-10
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined a family-directed program's effectiveness in
      preventing adolescent tobacco and alcohol use in a general population. METHODS:
      Adolescents aged 12 to 14 years and their families were identified by
      random-digit dialing throughout the contiguous United States. After providing
      baseline data by telephone interviews, they were randomly allocated to receive or
      not receive a family-directed program featuring mailed booklets and telephone
      contacts by health educators. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted 3 and
      12 months after program completion. RESULTS: The findings suggested that smoking 
      onset was reduced by 16.4% at 1 year, with a 25.0% reduction for non-Hispanic
      Whites but no statistically significant program effect for other
      races/ethnicities. There were no statistically significant program effects for
      smokeless tobacco or alcohol use onset. CONCLUSIONS: The family-directed program 
      was associated with reduced smoking onset for non-Hispanic Whites, suggesting
      that it is worthy of further application, development, and evaluation.

TI  - Lung cancer screening results in the National Cancer Institute New York study.
PG  - 2356-62
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anecdotal reports of radiologically occult early stage lung
      carcinomas detected by sputum cytology suggested that screening by cytology might
      lead to earlier diagnosis, more effective surgical therapy, and lower death rates
      from lung carcinoma. Thus, a randomized study was undertaken to evaluate sputum
      cytology as a lung carcinoma screening technique supplementing the chest X-ray.
      METHODS: Three major medical centers participated in the study, recruiting
      approximately 10,000 cigarette smoking men older than 45 years of age at each
      center: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) in New York, NY, Johns
      Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, MD, and The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. At
      MSKCC, the men were divided randomly into two groups: a dual screen group
      received four monthly sputum cytology examinations in addition to annual
      posteroanterior and lateral chest X-rays and an X-ray only group received annual 
      chest X-rays but no sputum examinations. The men suspected of lung carcinoma
      because of radiologic or sputum cytology findings were referred immediately for
      evaluation, and those with operable lung carcinoma were recommended for surgery
      and treated with intent to cure. RESULTS: The men who entered into the study
      remained in the screening program for 5- 8 years, depending on their date of
      enrollment, and were followed for 2 years after screening. Follow-up was
      completed on more than 99%. There were 53 of the 10,040 men in the study who were
      found to have lung carcinoma on initial examination (prevalence): 23 were in the 
      X-ray only group; of 30 found in the dual screen group, 9 (all with squamous cell
      carcinoma) were detected by cytology alone. During the entire study and the
      2-year follow-up period, 354 of the 10,040 men developed lung carcinoma, equally 
      divided between the dual screen and X-ray only groups. Nearly two-thirds (190
      men) had lesions that were detected by screening, and over 50% (100 men) were in 
      Stage I. Excluding oat cell carcinoma, during the screening period 175 of 250
      carcinomas (70%) were detected by screening. In contrast, during the 2-year
      post-screening period, 61 lung carcinomas were diagnosed of which only 12 (20%)
      were Stage I. Chest X-ray was most effective in detecting peripheral
      adenocarcinomas of the lung, which were the most common cell type. Cytology was
      most effective in detecting early epidermoid carcinomas of major bronchi. The
      epidermoid carcinomas grew slowly, metastasized late, and after becoming visible 
      by X-ray could be treated equally effectively as in the earlier occult stage.
      Forty percent of all the lung carcinomas were detected in Stage I, and at least
      two-thirds of the patients with Stage I lung carcinoma treated by complete
      resection did not die of their disease. Overall 5-year survival of all patients
      with lung carcinoma who had enrolled in the detection program was 35%, compared
      with 13% for the United States as a whole during this same time period.
      CONCLUSIONS: Sputum cytology and the chest X-ray complemented each other as lung 
      carcinoma detection techniques. The chest X-ray best detected peripheral
      adenocarcinomas of the lung, which are the most common type of lung carcinoma.
      Sputum cytology detected epidermoid carcinomas arising in major bronchi, but
      these are slow growing tumors that can be resected and cured after becoming
      visible by chest X-ray. Thus, for subjects at risk of lung carcinoma who could be
      followed by annual chest X-rays, sputum cytology did not improve survival, but
      for high risk subjects who had only a single screening examination, sputum
      cytology increased the number of early lung carcinomas detected. The design of
      the current study did not permit evaluation of chest X-ray screening versus
      nonscreening for prevention of death from lung carcinoma. However, the large
      proportion of Stage I lung carcinomas and the high survival rate of patients in
      this study compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program data
      strongly suggested that screening for lung carcinoma in high risk populations is 
      a valuable public health measure.

TI  - US public health service clinical practice guideline: treating tobacco use and
      dependence.
PG  - 1200-62
AB  - Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, a Public Health Service-sponsored Clinical
      Practice Guideline, is a product of the Tobacco Use and Dependence Guideline
      Panel ("the panel"), consortium representatives, consultants, and staff. These 30
      individuals were charged with the responsibility of identifying effective,
      experimentally validated tobacco dependence treatments and practices. The updated
      guideline was sponsored by a consortium of seven Federal Government and nonprofit
      organizations: the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), National
      Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, Robert Wood
      Johnson Foundation, and University of Wisconsin Medical School's Center for
      Tobacco Research and Intervention. This guideline is an updated version of the
      1996 Smoking Cessation Clinical Practice Guideline No. 18 that was sponsored by
      the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (now the AHRQ), United States
      Department of Health and Human Services. The original guideline reflected the
      extant scientific research literature published between 1975 and 1994. The
      updated guideline was written because new, effective clinical treatments for
      tobacco dependence have been identified since 1994. The accelerating pace of
      tobacco research that prompted the update is reflected in the fact that 3,000
      articles on tobacco were identified as published between 1975 and 1994,
      contributing to the original guideline. Another 3,000 were published between 1995
      and 1999 and contributed to the updated guideline. These 6,000 articles were
      screened and reviewed to identify a much smaller group of articles that served as
      the basis for guideline data analyses and panel opinion. This guideline contains 
      strategies and recommendations designed to assist clinicians, tobacco dependence 
      treatment specialists, and health care administrators, insurers, and purchasers
      in delivering and supporting effective treatments for tobacco use and dependence.
      The recommendations were made as a result of a systematic review and analysis of 
      the extant scientific literature, using meta-analysis as the primary analytic
      technique. The strength of evidence that served as the basis for each
      recommendation is clearly indicated in the guideline. A draft of the guideline
      was peer-reviewed prior to publication, and the comments of 70 external reviewers
      were incorporated into the final document. The key recommendations of the updated
      guideline, Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence, based on the literature review
      and expert panel opinion, are as follows: 1. Tobacco dependence is a chronic
      condition that often requires repeated intervention. However, effective
      treatments exist that can produce long-term or even permanent abstinence. 2.
      Because effective tobacco dependence treatments are available, every patient who 
      uses tobacco should be offered at least one of these treatments: Patients willing
      to try to quit tobacco use should be provided with treatments identified as
      effective in this guideline. Patients unwilling to try to quit tobacco use should
      be provided with a brief intervention designed to increase their motivation to
      quit. 3. It is essential that clinicians and health care delivery systems
      (including administrators, insurers, and purchasers) institutionalize the
      consistent identification, documentation, and treatment of every tobacco user
      seen in a health care setting. 4. Brief tobacco dependence treatment is
      effective, and every patient who uses tobacco should be offered at least brief
      treatment. 5. There is a strong dose-response relation between the intensity of
      tobacco dependence counseling and its effectiveness. Treatments involving
      person-to-person contact (via individual, group, or proactive telephone
      counseling) are consistently effective, and their effectiveness increases with
      treatment intensity (eg, minutes of contact). 6. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)

TI  - Effects of beta-carotene supplementation on cancer incidence by baseline
      characteristics in the Physicians' Health Study (United States).
PG  - 617-26
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Physicians' Health Study (PHS) was a randomized trial of
      beta-carotene (50 mg, alternate days) and aspirin in primary prevention of cancer
      and cardiovascular disease among 22,071 US male physicians. This report updates
      results for beta-carotene and examines effect modification by baseline
      characteristics. METHODS: Beta-carotene's effect on cancer over nearly 13 years
      was examined overall and within subgroups defined by baseline characteristics
      using proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: 2667 incident cancers were confirmed,
      with 1117 prostate, 267 colon, and 178 lung cancers. There were no significant
      differences with supplementation in total (relative risk (RR) = 1.0, 95%
      confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-1.0); prostate (RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.9-1.1); colon
      (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2); or lung (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.2) cancer, and no
      differences over time. In subgroup analyses, total cancer was modestly reduced
      with supplementation among those aged 70+ years (RR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.7-1.0),
      daily drinkers of alcohol (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8-1.0), and those in the highest 
      BMI quartile (RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.0). Prostate cancer was reduced with
      supplementation among those in the highest BMI quartile (RR = 0.8, 95% CI =
      0.6-1.0), and colon cancer was reduced among daily drinkers of alcohol (RR = 0.5,
      95% CI = 0.3-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: The PHS found no overall effect of beta-carotene 
      on total cancer, or the three most common site-specific cancers. The possibility 
      of risk reduction within specific subgroups remains.

TI  - Preventive health care, 1999 update: prevention of oral cancer mortality. The
      Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.
PG  - 617
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 3,000 new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed each year 
      in Canada. Most of these cases occur among older adults with a history of tobacco
      use or excessive alcohol consumption. Preventive interventions for oral cancer
      include counselling of patients to modify risk factors and screening to identify 
      precancerous and early-stage lesions. This report presents evidence-based
      guidelines on the prevention of oral cancer and precancer among asymptomatic
      patients. METHODS: Literature searches of the 1966-1999 MEDLINE and CANCERLIT
      databases were completed using the major MeSH heading mouth neoplasms. References
      from articles and recommendations of organizations were also reviewed. The
      evidence-based methods of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care were 
      used to assess evidence and to develop guidelines. Advice from experts and other 
      recommendations were taken into consideration. RESULTS: In cohort and
      case-control studies, smoking cessation decreased the risk of oral cancer and
      precancer. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicate counselling by trained
      health care professionals is effective in promoting smoking cessation. Although
      counselling has been effective for the reduction of excessive alcohol consumption
      in RCTs, no studies have examined whether alcohol reduction reduces the risk of
      oral cancer or precancer. The usefulness of general population screening is
      limited by the low prevalence and incidence of the disease, the potential for
      false-positive diagnoses and the poor compliance with screening and referral.
      There is no evidence that screening of the general population or high-risk groups
      leads to a reduction in mortality or morbidity from oral cancer. INTERPRETATION: 
      There is good evidence to specifically consider smoking cessation counselling in 
      a periodic health examination (grade A recommendation). For population screening,
      there is fair evidence to specifically exclude screening for oral cancer (grade D
      recommendation). For opportunistic screening during periodic examinations, there 
      is insufficient evidence to recommend inclusion or exclusion of screening for
      oral cancer (grade C recommendation). For patients at high risk, annual
      examination by physician or dentist should be considered. Risk factors include
      tobacco use and excessive consumption of alcohol. These recommendations are
      similar to those made by the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health
      Examination in 1994 and by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 1996.

TI  - The alcohol hangover.
PG  - 897-902
AB  - PURPOSE: To review the cause, pathophysiologic characteristics, cost, and
      treatment of alcohol-induced hangover. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of
      English-language reports (1966 to 1999) and a manual search of bibliographies of 
      relevant papers. STUDY SELECTION: Related experimental, clinical, and basic
      research studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Data in relevant articles were reviewed, and
      relevant clinical information was extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: The alcohol hangover
      is characterized by headache, tremulousness, nausea, diarrhea, and fatigue
      combined with decreased occupational, cognitive, or visual-spatial skill
      performance. In the United States, related absenteeism and poor job performance
      cost $148 billion annually (average annual cost per working adult, $2000).
      Although hangover is associated with alcoholism, most of its cost is incurred by 
      the light-to-moderate drinker. Patients with hangover may pose substantial risk
      to themselves and others despite having a normal blood alcohol level. Hangover
      may also be an independent risk factor for cardiac death. Symptoms of hangover
      seem to be caused by dehydration, hormonal alterations, dysregulated cytokine
      pathways, and toxic effects of alcohol. Physiologic characteristics include
      increased cardiac work with normal peripheral resistance, diffuse slowing on
      electroencephalography, and increased levels of antidiuretic hormone. Effective
      interventions include rehydration, prostaglandin inhibitors, and vitamin B6.
      Screening for hangover severity and frequency may help early detection of alcohol
      dependency and substantially improve quality of life. Recommended interventions
      include discussion of potential therapies and reminders of the possibility for
      cognitive and visual-spatial impairment. No evidence suggests that alleviation of
      hangover symptoms leads to further alcohol consumption, and the discomfort caused
      by such symptoms may do so. Therefore, treatment seems warranted. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hangover, a common disorder, has substantial morbidity and societal cost.
      Appropriate management may relieve symptoms in many patients.

TI  - Diagnosis of superficial esophageal cancer and dysplasia using endoscopic
      screening with a 2% lugol dye solution in patients with head and neck cancer.
PG  - 170-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: Head and neck cancer (HNC) has a high incidence in Brazil, with
      cancer of the oral cavity being one of the five most common cancers among
      Brazilians. Alcohol and tobacco consumption may contribute to synchronous or
      metachronous HNC and esophageal cancer. The early detection of superficial
      esophageal cancer and dysplasia in asymptomatic patients with HNC, after
      successfully treating the primary cancer, may provide an effective cure. METHODS:
      A prospective study involving 60 patients with HNC was carried out at the State
      University of Campinas (UNICAMP) to screen for superficial esophageal cancer and 
      dysplasia using endoscopy and a 2% lugol dye solution followed by biopsy of the
      suspicious areas. RESULTS: Five patients (8.3%) had superficial esophageal
      cancer, which was diagnosed as intraepithelial carcinoma in three of them (5.0%).
      In four patients, the superficial esophageal cancer was synchronous, and in one
      it was metachronous to HNC. Five patients (8.3%) had dysplasias in the esophageal
      epithelium (three were classified as mild and two as moderate). CONCLUSION: These
      results demonstrate the value of endoscopic screening of the esophagus using
      lugol dye in patients with HNC, particularly because superficial esophageal
      cancer is extremely difficult to detect by conventional methods in asymptomatic
      patients.

TI  - Violent injuries among women in an urban area.
PG  - 1899-905
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the rate of death from injuries due to violent acts is much 
      higher among black women than among white women in the United States, little is
      known about the nature and correlates of violent injuries among black women
      living in urban areas. METHODS: In this case-control study conducted at three
      emergency departments in one inner-city community (in west Philadelphia), we
      studied 405 adolescent girls and women who had been intentionally injured and 520
      adolescent girls and women (control subjects) who had health problems not related
      to violent injury. Data were collected by conducting standardized interviews with
      use of questionnaires and by screening urine for illicit drugs. Individual
      logistic-regression models were constructed to identify factors associated with
      violent injuries inflicted by partners and those inflicted by persons other than 
      the partners of the victims. RESULTS: The male partners of the injured women were
      much more likely than the male partners of control subjects to use cocaine (odds 
      ratio, 4.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 8.4) and to have been arrested
      in the past (odds ratio, 3.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 5.2).
      Fifty-three percent of violent injuries to the women had been perpetrated by
      persons other than their partners. Women's use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse
      were factors associated with both violence on the part of partners and violence
      on the part of other persons. Neighborhood characteristics, including low median 
      income, a high rate of change of residence, and poor education, were
      independently associated with the risk of violent injuries among women.
      CONCLUSIONS: Women in this urban, low-income community face violence from both
      partners and other persons. Substance abuse, particularly cocaine use, is a
      significant correlate of violent injuries. Standard Census data may help identify
      neighborhoods where women are at high risk for such violence and that would
      benefit from community-level interventions.

TI  - Use of Western-based HIV risk-reduction interventions targeting adolescents in an
      African setting.
PG  - 52-61
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate an intervention (based on one which had previously been
      successful in reducing adolescent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk
      behaviors in the United States) among adolescents residing in Namibia, a country 
      located in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A randomized trial of a 14-session
      face-to-face intervention emphasizing abstinence and safer sex was conducted
      among 515 youth (median age 17 years; median grade 11) attending 10 secondary
      schools located in two districts in Namibia. Knowledge, attitudes, intentions,
      and HIV risk behaviors were assessed at baseline and in the immediate
      postintervention period. RESULTS: Knowledge increased significantly among
      intervention compared to control youth (88% vs. 82%; correct responses, p <
      .0001). At postintervention follow-up, more intervention than control youth
      believed that they could be intimate without having sex, could have a girlfriend 
      or boyfriend for a long time without having sex, could explain the process of
      impregnation, knew how to use a condom, and could ask for condoms in a clinic.
      Fewer intervention than control youth believed that if a girl refused to have sex
      with her boyfriend it was permissible for him to strike her, and that condoms
      took away a boy's pleasure. More intervention than control youth anticipated
      using a condom when they did have sex, and fewer expected to drink alcohol.
      Finally, after intervention, there was a trend for increased condom use. There
      were significant gender-related differences at baseline, although intervention
      impact was generally equivalent. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support for 
      the judicious adaptation of successful Western HIV prevention programs in other
      cultural settings. A single intervention approach appears to be effective in
      short-term follow-up with both genders.

      on alcohol consumption. Canadian Hypertension Society, Canadian Coalition for
      High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, Laboratory Centre for Disease Control
      at Health Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.
PG  - S13-20
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations concerning the
      effects of alcohol consumption on the prevention and control of hypertension in
      otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women). OPTIONS: There are 2 main
      options for those at risk for hypertension: avert the condition by limiting
      alcohol consumption or by using other nonpharmacologic methods, or maintain or
      increase the risk of hypertension by making no change in alcohol consumption. The
      options for those who already have hypertension include decreasing alcohol
      consumption or using another nonpharmacologic method to reduce hypertension;
      commencing, continuing or intensifying antihypertensive medication; or taking no 
      action and remaining at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. OUTCOMES: The
      health outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure and in morbidity and
      mortality rates. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic outcomes were
      considered. EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period 1966-1996
      with the terms ethyl alcohol and hypertension. Other relevant evidence was
      obtained from the reference lists of articles identified, from the personal files
      of the authors and through contacts with experts. The articles were reviewed,
      classified according to study design, and graded according to the level of
      evidence. VALUES: A high value was placed on the avoidance of cardiovascular
      morbidity and premature death caused by untreated hypertension. BENEFITS, HARMS
      AND COSTS: A reduction in alcohol consumption from more than 2 standard drinks
      per day reduces the blood pressure of both hypertensive and normotensive people. 
      The lowest overall mortality rates in observational studies were associated with 
      drinking habits that were within these guidelines. Side effects and costs were
      not measured in any of the studies. RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) It is recommended that
      health care professionals determine how much alcohol their patients consume. (2) 
      To reduce blood pressure in the population at large, it is recommended that
      alcohol consumption be in accordance with Canadian low-risk drinking guidelines
      (i.e., healthy adults who choose to drink should limit alcohol consumption to 2
      or fewer standard drinks per day, with consumption not exceeding 14 standard
      drinks per week for men and 9 standard drinks per week for women). (3)
      Hypertensive patients should also be advised to limit alcohol consumption to the 
      levels set out in the Canadian low-risk drinking guidelines. VALIDATION: These
      recommendations are similar to those of the World Hypertension League, the
      National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on Primary
      Prevention of Hypertension and the previous recommendations of the Canadian
      Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control and the Canadian
      Hypertension Society. They have not been clinically tested. The low-risk drinking
      guidelines are those of the Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario and the
      Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse. SPONSORS: The Canadian Hypertension Society, 
      the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, the
      Laboratory Centre for Disease Control at Health Canada, and the Heart and Stroke 
      Foundation of Canada. The low-risk drinking guidelines have been endorsed by the 
      College of Family Physicians of Canada and several provincial organizations.

      overview of the Canadian recommendations. Canadian Hypertension Society, Canadian
      Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention and Control, Laboratory Centre for
      Disease Control at Health Canada, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.
PG  - S1-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide updated, evidence-based recommendations for health care
      professionals on lifestyle changes to prevent and control hypertension in
      otherwise healthy adults (except pregnant women). OPTIONS: For people at risk for
      hypertension, there are a number of lifestyle options that may avert the
      condition--maintaining a healthy body weight, moderating consumption of alcohol, 
      exercising, reducing sodium intake, altering intake of calcium, magnesium and
      potassium, and reducing stress. Following these options will maintain or reduce
      the risk of hypertension. For people who already have hypertension, the options
      for controlling the condition are lifestyle modification, antihypertensive
      medications or a combination of these options; with no treatment, these people
      remain at risk for the complications of hypertension. OUTCOMES: The health
      outcomes considered were changes in blood pressure and in morbidity and mortality
      rates. Because of insufficient evidence, no economic outcomes were considered.
      EVIDENCE: A MEDLINE search was conducted for the period January 1996 to September
      1996 for each of the interventions studied. Reference lists were scanned, experts
      were polled, and the personal files of the authors were used to identify other
      studies. All relevant articles were reviewed, classified according to study
      design and graded according to level of evidence. VALUES: A high value was placed
      on the avoidance of cardiovascular morbidity and premature death caused by
      untreated hypertension. BENEFITS, HARMS AND COSTS: Lifestyle modification by
      means of weight loss (or maintenance of healthy body weight), regular exercise
      and low alcohol consumption will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately
      selected normotensive and hypertensive people. Sodium restriction and stress
      management will reduce the blood pressure of appropriately selected hypertensive 
      patients. The side effects of these therapies are few, and the indirect benefits 
      are well known. There are certainly costs associated with lifestyle modification,
      but they were not measured in the studies reviewed. Supplementing the diet with
      potassium, calcium and magnesium has not been associated with a clinically
      important reduction in blood pressure in people consuming a healthy diet.
      RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) It is recommended that health care professionals determine
      the body mass index (weight in kilograms/[height in metres]2) and alcohol
      consumption of all adult patients and assess sodium consumption and stress levels
      in all hypertensive patients. (2) To reduce blood pressure in the population at
      large, it is recommended that Canadians attain and maintain a healthy body mass
      index. For those who choose to drink alcohol intake should be limited to 2 or
      fewer standard drinks per day (maximum of 14/week for men and 9/week for women). 
      Adults should exercise regularly. (3) To reduce blood pressure in hypertensive
      patients, individualized therapy is recommended. This therapy should emphasize
      weight loss for overweight patients, abstinence from or moderation in alcohol
      intake, regular exercise, restriction of sodium intake and, in appropriate
      circumstances, individualized cognitive behaviour modification to reduce the
      negative effects of stress. VALIDATION: The recommendations were reviewed by all 
      of the sponsoring organizations and by participants in a satellite symposium of
      the fourth international Conference on Preventive Cardiology. They are similar to
      those of the World Hypertension League and the Joint National committee, with the
      exception of the recommendations on stress management, which are based on new
      information. They have not been clinically tested. SPONSORS: The Canadian
      Hypertension Society, the Canadian Coalition for High Blood Pressure Prevention
      and Control, the Laboratory Centre for Disease Control at health Canada, and the 
      Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

PG  - 1313-33
AB  - AIMS: (1) To examine the matching hypothesis that Twelve Step Facilitation
      Therapy (TSF) is more effective than Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) for
      alcohol-dependent clients with networks highly supportive of drinking 3 years
      following treatment; (2) to test a causal chain providing the rationale for this 
      effect. DESIGN: Outpatients were re-interviewed 3 years following treatment.
      ANCOVAs tested the matching hypothesis. SETTING: Outpatients from five clinical
      research units distributed across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred 
      and six alcohol-dependent clients. INTERVENTION: Clients were randomly assigned
      to one of three 12-week, manually-guided, individual treatments: TSF, MET or
      Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBT). MEASUREMENTS: Network support
      for drinking prior to treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) involvement during and
      following treatment, percentage of days abstinent and drinks per drinking day
      during months 37-39. FINDINGS: (1) The a priori matching hypothesis that TSF is
      more effective than MET for clients with networks supportive of drinking was
      supported at the 3 year follow-up; (2) AA involvement was a partial mediator of
      this effect; clients with networks supportive of drinking assigned to TSF were
      more likely to be involved in AA; AA involvement was associated with better
      3-year drinking outcomes for such clients. CONCLUSIONS: (1) In the long-term TSF 
      may be the treatment of choice for alcohol-dependent clients with networks
      supportive of drinking; (2) involvement in AA should be given special
      consideration for clients with networks supportive of drinking, irrespective of
      the therapy they will receive.

TI  - The specific deterrence of administrative per se laws in reducing drunk driving
      recidivism.
PG  - 68-75
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if administrative per se laws are more effective than
      other forms of sanction against drunk drivers. SEARCH STRATEGIES: The overall
      goal of the search strategy was to identify all relevant research concerning the 
      specific effects of administrative per se laws in reducing drunk driving
      recidivism, traffic crashes, and other alcohol-related driving offenses by those 
      drivers with suspended licenses. Known review articles and MEDLINE reviews formed
      the reference bibliography; numerous databases were searched from 1966 to the
      present, using such terms as alcohol, driver's license, recidivism, deterrence,
      and legislation. SELECTION CRITERIA: To be selected the study had to be designed 
      to test the presence of an administrative per se license revocation or
      restriction in a defined cohort, have a suitable comparison cohort whose
      sanctions for drunk driving were not administrative per se, and provide relevant 
      data that lead to an objective assessment of recidivism. Types of studies
      included were randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials,
      other specialized cohort studies, and case-control studies. Three studies were
      identified; all met inclusion criteria. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One of the 
      studies provided Kaplan-Meier survival curves for failure times defined as days
      to new conviction following the initial arrest. Odds ratios and 99% confidence
      intervals were extracted from two of the studies and additional information was
      supplied by the author of one of the studies. MAIN RESULTS: One study found that 
      one state in the United States experienced a reduction of about one third in
      repeat arrests for drunk driving over a 3-year period among those who were
      arrested under administrative per se, relative to recidivism seen in a comparison
      cohort of drivers prior to administrative per se. Two other states did not
      experience any change in recidivism. The second study found that drivers whose
      licenses were suspended under administrative per se were 39% less likely during
      the first year following suspension to be rearrested on the charge of driving
      while intoxicated compared with a comparison cohort. This differential persisted 
      into the second year of follow-up, but disappeared by the third year. The third
      study found both first offenders and repeat offenders arrested under
      administrative per se were 34% less likely to be involved during the year
      following their arrest in a subsequent motor vehicle crash compared with those in
      the comparison cohort. Drivers with administrative per se suspensions were 21%
      less likely to be involved in additional drunk driving offenses, and 27% less
      likely to be involved in reckless driving offenses related to alcohol.
      CONCLUSIONS: Administrative per se laws governing license restriction for drivers
      have been shown to be effective in some states but not others in decreasing the
      rates at which these same drivers are subsequently involved in a motor vehicle
      crash or in another alcohol-related offense, compared with drivers who were
      sanctioned through other conventional judicial processes. Replications are needed
      in other states or large driver populations using improved methodology.

TI  - The effect of random alcohol screening in reducing motor vehicle crash injuries.
PG  - 57-67
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Programs that randomly stop drivers to detect alcohol use have been
      introduced as a deterrence measure for drinking and driving. The objective of
      this review is to determine if this random screening reduces fatalities and
      injuries. The two types of random screening programs included are Random Breath
      Testing and Sobriety Checkpoints. METHODS: Fourteen studies met inclusion
      criteria, which required an evaluation of a random screening program with a
      control population or baseline comparison. Proportional decreases in total or
      alcohol-related fatalities or injuries were the outcome of interest. MAIN
      RESULTS: All fourteen studies found that random screening was effective in
      reducing fatalities and injuries. The decreases found had wide variation, but did
      not depend on the size of the population. Alcohol-related fatalities generally
      showed the greatest decreases, ranging from 8% to 71%. The few multivariate
      analyses showed that random screening significantly reduced crashes and injuries.
      CONCLUSIONS: Random screening appears to be effective in a wide range of both
      United States and Australian populations. Although there are many limitations to 
      the studies reviewed, such as the difficulty in determining alcohol involvement
      and the inability to control for the presence of other drunk driving reduction
      programs, the weight of the evidence indicates that random screening reduces
      fatalities and injuries. There was some disagreement among studies as to how long
      the effects of random alcohol screening can be sustained and the level of
      enforcement necessary, and these remain questions to be answered.

TI  - Effects of an HIV risk reduction project on sexual risk behavior of low-income
      STD patients.
PG  - 483-92
AB  - A 10-hour small-group informational and skill-building intervention was tested
      among patients (N = 472) attending publicly funded sexually transmitted disease
      clinics in Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey. After completing a 90-minute
      interview concerning HIV risk behaviors, condom use self-efficacy and condom
      outcome expectancies, participants were randomized to either an intervention or a
      control condition. Participants in both conditions displayed significant
      reductions in unprotected encounters and number of partners and increases in
      condom use. No differences between treatment conditions were observed, indicating
      that the motivational effects of the interview may have been stronger than the
      effects of the intervention in this population.

OAB - PIP: Sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment services in low-income
      communities offer an effective arena for accessing those at greatest risk for HIV
      infection. This study evaluated an intensive HIV risk reduction program
      implemented in publicly funded STD clinics in Maryland, Georgia, and New Jersey
      (US). After completion of a 90-minute interview on HIV risk behaviors, condom use
      self-efficacy, and condom outcome expectancies, the 472 study participants were
      randomly assigned to either a 10-hour behavioral intervention designed to
      increase condom use self-efficacy through modeling and skill building or routine 
      brief counseling. The average age of respondents was 30.1 years; they reported an
      average of 3.2 lifetime STDs. Participants in both the intervention and control
      groups reported significant reductions in the number of sexual partners and
      unprotected sexual encounters and significant increases in condom use at the
      90-day follow-up interview, with no significant differences between groups. Four 
      possible moderators of behavior change--gender, crack or heroin use, alcohol
      problems, and child sex abuse--were not significant. The possibility that the
      baseline interview, not the intervention, motivated the observed changes in
      sexual behavior merits consideration.

TI  - Early and late weight gain following smoking cessation in the Lung Health Study.
PG  - 821-30
AB  - The authors examine weight gains associated with smoking cessation in the Lung
      Health Study (1986-1994) over a 5-year follow-up period. A cohort of 5,887 male
      and female smokers in the United States and Canada, aged 35-60 years, were
      randomized to either smoking intervention or usual care. Among participants who
      achieved sustained quitting for 5 years, women gained a mean of 5.2 (standard
      error, 5.0) kg in year 1 and a mean of 3.4 (standard error, 5.5) kg in years 1-5.
      Men gained a mean of 4.9 (standard error, 4.9) kg in year 1 and a mean of 2.6
      (standard error, 5.8) kg in years 1-5. In regression analyses, smoking-change
      variables were the most potent predictors of weight change. Participants going
      from smoking to quit-smoking in a given year had mean weight gains of 2.95
      kg/year (3.61%) in men and 3.09 kg/year (4.69%) in women. Over 5 years, 33% of
      sustained quitters gained > or = 10 kg compared with 6% of continuing smokers.
      Also among sustained quitters, 7.6% of men and 19.1% of women gained > or = 20%
      of baseline weight; 60% of the gain occurred in year 1, although significant
      weight gains continued through year 5. The average gains and the high proportions
      of sustained and intermittent quitters who gained excessive weight suggest the
      need for more effective early interventions that address both smoking cessation
      and weight control.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and mortality. III. Studies of female populations.
PG  - 219-29
AB  - AIMS: This is the third of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and
      mortality risk. Analysis of three general population surveys of women evaluated
      all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data 
      from three studies of adult women were evaluated. Logistic regression models
      controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis combined study results.
      MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined by quantity, frequency
      and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking pattern (including
      long-term abstainers and former drinkers) as well as age and other confounding
      variables. Models also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term
      abstinence and former drinking. FINDINGS: In models in which age was controlled, 
      odds of death for long-term abstainers and former drinkers (defined by volume or 
      quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers; odds of death for moderate 
      and heavy drinkers (defined by quantity) were greater than those for light
      drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes were controlled, odds of death were 
      similar for abstainers and light drinkers. When other psychosocial attributes
      were controlled, odds of death for heavy drinkers (defined by volume and
      quantity) were greater than those for light drinkers. When interactions of age
      and the two forms of abstinence were introduced, one study showed a significant
      effect of age and former drinking. CONCLUSIONS: Results were consistent with the 
      hypothesis that characteristics of abstainers other than their non-use of alcohol
      may account for their higher mortality risk. With the exception of former
      drinkers compared to light drinkers, when interactions were introduced into
      models (for measures of quantity and frequency) findings were homogeneous across 
      studies, lending generalizability to results.

TI  - Alcohol consumption and mortality. II. Studies of male populations.
PG  - 205-18
AB  - AIMS: This is the second of a set of three papers evaluating drinking status and 
      mortality risk. Analysis of eight general population surveys of men evaluated
      all-cause mortality rates by drinking pattern. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Raw data 
      from three studies of youth and five studies of adults were evaluated. Logistic
      regression models controlled for confounding characteristics. Meta-analysis
      combined study results. MEASUREMENTS: Drinking pattern was alternatively defined 
      by quantity, frequency and volume of drinking. Final models included drinking
      pattern (as well as abstinence in the youth models and long-term abstainers and
      former drinkers in adult models), age and other confounding variables. Models
      also evaluated interactions of age and, respectively, long-term abstinence and
      former drinking. FINDINGS: No evidence was found for the hypothesis that
      abstinence is associated with greater mortality risk than light drinking. In the 
      youth samples, abstainers had a lower risk of dying than those drinking less than
      15 times per month. One study of the adult samples showed a significant age by
      former drinker interaction; this did not alter the lack of association of former 
      drinking with mortality risk or the homogeneity of results across studies for
      this finding. The most consistent finding was the association of heavy drinking
      with mortality among youth. Among adults, drinking 43 or more drinks per month
      and drinking 21 or more times per month were associated with increased mortality 
      risk. Quantity per occasion was not significantly associated with mortality risk 
      among adults. CONCLUSIONS: That frequent drinking was related to mortality risk, 
      whereas heavier quantity was unrelated, is inconsistent with the belief that
      daily consumption of a few glasses of wine has salutary effects. Empirically,
      however, this pattern tends to be unusual. Findings were homogeneous across
      studies lending generalizability to results.

AB  - The US Lung Health Study was a randomized clinical trial carried out in 10
      clinical centres in the United States of America and Canada that enrolled 5887
      male and female smokers age 35-60 years with early chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      disease (COPD). Its purpose was to determine whether a programme incorporating
      smoking intervention and use of an inhaled bronchodilator (ipratropium bromide)
      can slow the rate of decline in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
      in middle aged smokers with early COPD. Participants were randomized with equal
      probability into three groups: (i) smoking intervention plus bronchodilator; (ii)
      smoking intervention plus placebo; or (iii) no intervention. The primary outcome 
      was rate of change and cumulative change in FEV1 over a 5 year period. The
      primary finding was that the use of the bronchodilator did not influence the
      long-term decline in FEV1. However, the aggressive smoking intervention programme
      significantly reduced the age-related decline in FEV1.

PG  - 490-5
AB  - This study experimentally tested the effects of a drinking event on HIV-related
      behavioral skills and condom attitudes. Sixty unmarried, heterosexual men were
      assigned to 1 of 3 conditions (sober, placebo, or alcohol). Participants who
      consumed alcohol demonstrated lower skill to negotiate for condom use relative to
      sober controls. More negative condom attitudes were expressed by participants
      with stronger sex-related alcohol expectancies, especially when these
      expectancies were triggered by subjective intoxication. Hierarchical regression
      analyses revealed that the experimental factors accounted for variance in
      behavioral skills and condom attitudes beyond that explained by known predictors 
      of sexual risk.

OAB - PIP: 60 unmarried, heterosexual men of mean age 24.9 years were recruited from
      the community through newspaper advertisements and flyers to participate in a
      study to evaluate the effects of drinking-related and dispositional variables on 
      the antecedents of safer sex behavior. 87% of the men were White, 72% drank
      alcohol 3-4 times per week, 75% had multiple sex partners in the past year (an
      average of 3.2 partners), 72% did not always use condoms, and all were told that 
      they would be participating in an alcohol and communication study. The men were
      assigned to 1 of 3 conditions, sober, placebo, or alcohol, to experimentally test
      the effects of a drinking event upon HIV-related behavioral skills and condom
      attitudes. Men in the alcohol group received vodka and tonic drinks, men in the
      placebo group received all tonic drinks with a bit of vodka rubbed on the glass
      to make the subjects think that the drinks contained vodka, and men in the sober 
      group received only tonic water. 20 men were in each group. All drinks were made 
      in the presence of the subjects, with the tonic being poured from a
      vodka-labelled bottle in the placebo group. Participants were instructed to
      finish their drinks in 30 minutes, after which time they participated in
      role-play scenarios. The men who consumed alcohol demonstrated lower skill in
      negotiating condom use relative to sober controls and were more likely to consent
      to sex without a condom. More negative condom attitudes were expressed by
      participants with stronger sex-related alcohol expectancies, especially when
      those expectancies were triggered by subjective intoxication. Regression analyses
      determined that the drinking event, especially beverage content, accounted for
      variance in behavioral skills and condom attitudes beyond that explained by known
      predictors of sexual risk.

TI  - Epidemiologic aspects of gallbladder cancer: a case-control study of the SEARCH
      Program of the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
PG  - 1132-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few previous epidemiologic studies of gallbladder cancer, a
      rare but nearly always lethal gastrointestinal cancer with a demonstrated greater
      frequency in adult women and older subjects of both sexes, and also in the
      members of populations throughout central and eastern Europe and certain racial
      groups such as native American Indians. Unfortunately, the prospects for the
      prevention of this form of cancer are poor. PURPOSE: Our purpose in conducting
      this study was to investigate possible new risk factors for gallbladder cancer
      and to strengthen our understanding of established causal agents that may be
      involved in this disease. METHODS: A large, collaborative, multicenter,
      case-control study of cancer of the gallbladder was conducted in five centers
      located in Australia (Adelaide), Canada (Montreal and Toronto), The Netherlands
      (Utrecht), and Poland (Opole) from January 1983 through July 1988. Case subjects 
      with gallbladder cancer were accrued by the centers from hospital pathology
      records and from reports to regional cancer registries. Cancer diagnosis was
      confirmed by either biopsy, cholecystectomy, or at the time of autopsy. Control
      subjects were randomly assigned at each center from the population. The pooled
      analysis included 196 case subjects and 1515 control subjects (who did not report
      previous cholecystectomy). Ninety-eight percent of the subjects were white.
      Personal interviews of case subjects, control subjects, and surrogates (spouse or
      next of kin) were conducted by trained personnel. RESULTS: After adjusting for
      potential confounding factors (age, sex, center, type of interview, years of
      schooling, alcohol intake, and lifetime cigarette smoking), a history of
      gallbladder symptoms requiring medical attention (e.g., reduced bile secretion
      from the gallbladder into the small intestine due to obstructions of the common
      bile or cystic ducts) was the major risk factor associated with this form of
      cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6-7.5). This
      association was present even in subjects who had their first gallbladder
      examination because of symptoms present more than 20 years earlier (OR = 6.2; 95%
      CI = 2.8-13.4). Other variables associated with gallbladder cancer risk included 
      an elevated body mass index, high total energy intake, high carbohydrate intake
      (after adjustment for total energy intake), and chronic diarrhea. All of these
      risk factors have been previously associated with gallstone disease. CONCLUSIONS:
      These findings are consistent with a major role of gallstones, or risk factors
      for gallstones, in the cause of gallbladder cancer. Additional information on
      whether or not screening high-risk subjects for gallstones or gallbladder cancer 
      is needed.

TI  - Smoking cessation after surgery. A randomized trial.
PG  - 1371-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is the greatest cause of preventable mortality in
      the United States. Because most smokers would like to quit and most hospitals are
      smoke free, surgical admissions represent a window of opportunity for tobacco
      cessation interventions. METHODS: A total of 324 patients (98% men), aged 25 to
      82 years, who were current smokers and who underwent noncardiac surgery were
      enrolled in a randomized controlled trial at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center,
      San Francisco, Calif. One hundred sixty-eight participants (52%) received a
      multicomponent intervention designed to increase self-efficacy and coping skills 
      that included face-to-face in-hospital counseling, viewing a smoking cessation
      videotape, self-help literature, nicotine replacement therapy, and 3 months of
      telephone follow-up. One hundred fifty-six participants (48%) received self-help 
      literature and brief counseling lasting 10 minutes. Serum or saliva cotinine
      levels were measured to confirm self-reported smoking cessation. RESULTS: At 12
      months of follow-up, the self-reported quit rate was 27% among the intervention
      group and 13% among the comparison group (relative risk, 2.1; 95% confidence
      interval, 1.2-3.5; P < .01). Based on biochemical confirmation, 15% of the
      intervention group, compared with 8% of the comparison group, quit smoking at 12 
      months (relative risk, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.9; P = .04).
      CONCLUSIONS: A smoking cessation intervention targeted at smokers hospitalized
      for noncardiac surgery can increase long-term quit rates. Surgical
      hospitalizations provide an opportunity to reach smokers who want to quit
      smoking.

TI  - The role of the pediatrician in smoking prevention.
PG  - 225-9
AB  - Smoking prevention during childhood and adolescence is critical to the successful
      reduction of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The
      research literature is replete with surveys describing youth smoking acquisition 
      and related factors. In addition to its direct harm, tobacco use may be a gateway
      to other substance abuse and a marker of other health-compromising behaviors. The
      pediatrician can play an important role in prevention by screening all patients
      and providing individual counseling. The pediatrician can also contribute as a
      consultant and advocate of school- and community-based smoking prevention
      efforts. Such a multicomponent approach provides the greatest likelihood of
      accelerating the decline in smoking and smokeless tobacco initiation.

TI  - Relationships of quality-of-life measures to long-term lifestyle and drug
      treatment in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study.
PG  - 638-48
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare 5 antihypertensive drugs and placebo for changes in
      quality of life (QL). To assess the relationship of lifestyle factors and change 
      in lifestyle factors to QL in participants with stage I diastolic hypertension.
      METHODS: The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) was a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial with minimum participant
      follow-up of 4 years. It was conducted at 4 hypertension screening and treatment 
      academic centers in the United States. The cohort consisted of 902 men and women 
      with hypertension, aged 45 to 69 years, with diastolic blood pressures less than 
      100 mm Hg. Informed consent was obtained from each participant after the nature
      of the procedures had been fully explained. Sustained nutritional-hygienic
      intervention was administered to all participants to reduce weight, to reduce
      dietary sodium and alcohol intake, and to increase physical activity.
      Participants were randomized to take (1) acebutolol (n = 132); (2) amlodipine
      maleate (n = 131); (3) chlorthalidone (n = 126); (4) doxazosin mesylate (n =
      134); (5) enalapril maleate (n = 135); or placebo (n = 234). Changes in 7 QL
      indexes were assessed based on a 35-item questionnaire: (1) general health; (2)
      energy or fatigue; (3) mental health; (4) general functioning; (5) satisfaction
      with physical abilities; (6) social functioning; and (7) social contacts.
      RESULTS: At baseline, higher QL was associated with older age, more physical
      activity, lower obesity level, male gender, non-African American race, and higher
      educational level. Improvements in QL were observed in all randomized groups,
      including the placebo group during follow-up; greater improvements were observed 
      in the acebutolol and chlorthalidone groups and were evident throughout
      follow-up. The amount of weight loss, increase in physical activity, and level of
      attained blood pressure control during follow-up were related to greater
      improvements in QL. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stage I hypertension,
      antihypertensive treatment with any of 5 agents used in TOMHS does not impair QL.
      The diuretic chlorthali-done and the cardioselective beta-blocker acebutolol
      appear to improve QL the most. Success with lifestyle changes affecting weight
      loss and increase in physical activity relate to greater improvements in QL and
      show that these interventions, in addition to contributing to blood pressure
      control, have positive effects on the general well-being of the individual.

TI  - The cost-effectiveness of the nicotine transdermal patch for smoking cessation.
PG  - 264-70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is the single most preventable cause of premature mortality
      in the United States. In 13 double-blind, controlled trials, the nicotine
      transdermal patch has been demonstrated to be an effective aid to quitting
      smoking, even after 6 months of follow-up. Because physicians and payers may
      consider the cost of the patch to be prohibitive, we examine the
      cost-effectiveness of the nicotine patch as an adjunct to brief physician
      counseling during routine office visits. METHODS: We estimate the effectiveness
      of both patch use with brief counseling and counseling alone from meta-analysis
      of clinical trials. Benefits are measured in terms of years of life gained by
      those who quit, discounted at 5%. Costs include physician time and patch
      prescriptions. The incremental cost-effectiveness is quantified as cost per
      additional year of life saved when patch plus counseling is compared with brief
      physician counseling alone. RESULTS: Depending on age, the average costs per year
      of life saved range from $965 to $1,585 for men and from $1,634 to $2,360 for
      women. Incremental costs per year of life saved range from $1,796 to $2,949 for
      men and from $3,040 to $4,391 for women. CONCLUSION: The nicotine patch is
      cost-effective and less costly per year of life saved than other widely accepted 
      medical practices. Physicians and third-party payers should recommend the
      nicotine patch to patients who wish to stop smoking.

TI  - Long-term effects on plasma lipids of diet and drugs to treat hypertension.
      Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) Research Group.
PG  - 1549-56
AB  - OBJECTIVE: - To compare long-term plasma lipid changes among 6 antihypertensive
      treatment interventions for stage I (mild) hypertension. DESIGN: - Multicenter,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial. SETTING: - Four academic
      clinical research units in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: - A total of 902 men 
      and women, aged 45 to 69 years, with stage I diastolic hypertension (diastolic
      blood pressure <100 mm Hg), recruited from 11914 persons screened in their
      communities. INTERVENTIONS: - Participants were randomized to 1 of 6 treatment
      groups: (1) placebo, (2) beta-blocker (acebutolol), (3) calcium antagonist
      (amlodipine), (4) diuretic (chlorthalidone), (5) alpha1-antagonist (doxazosin),
      and (6) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril). All groups received 
      intensive lifestyle counseling to achieve weight loss, dietary sodium and alcohol
      reduction, and increased physical activity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: - Changes in
      plasma total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density
      lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides from baseline to annual visits
      through 4 years. RESULTS: - Mean changes in all plasma lipids were favorable in
      all groups. The degree of weight loss with fat-modified diet and exercise was
      significantly related to favorable lipid changes. Significant differences (P<.01)
      among groups for average changes during follow-up in each lipid were observed.
      Decreases in plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were greater with
      doxazosin and acebutolol (for plasma total cholesterol, 0.36 and 0.30 mmol/L
      [13.8 and 11.7 mg/dL], respectively), less with chlorthalidone and placebo (0.12 
      and 0.13 mmol/L [4.5 and 5.1 mg/dL], respectively). Decreases in triglycerides
      were greater with doxazosin and enalapril, least with acebutolol. Increases in
      HDL cholesterol were greater with enalapril and doxazosin, least with acebutolol.
      Significant relative increases in plasma total cholesterol with chlorthalidone
      compared with placebo at 12 months were no longer present at 24 months and
      beyond, when mean plasma total cholesterol for the chlorthalidone group fell
      below baseline. Analyses of participants continuing to receive chlorthalidone
      throughout the 4 years of follow-up indicated this was not due solely to an
      increasing percentage of participants changing or discontinuing use of medication
      during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: - Weight loss with a fat-modified diet plus
      increased exercise produces favorable long-term effects on blood pressure and all
      plasma lipid fractions of adults with stage I hypertension; blood pressure
      reduction is enhanced to a similar degree by addition of a drug from any one of 5
      classes of antihypertensive medication. These drugs differ quantitatively in
      influencing the degree of long-term favorable effects on blood lipids obtained
      with nutritional-hygienic treatment.

      Risk Factor Intervention Trial: II. Black men.
PG  - 497-504
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined socioeconomic differentials in risk of death from
      a number of causes in a large cohort of Black men in the United States. METHODS: 
      For 20 224 Black men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial
      between 1973 and 1975, data were collected on median family income of Black
      households in zip code of residence, age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure,
      serum cholesterol, previous heart attack, and drug treatment for diabetes. The
      2937 deaths that occurred over the 16-year follow-up period were grouped into
      specific causes and related to median Black family income. RESULTS: There was an 
      inverse association between age-adjusted all-cause mortality and median family
      income. There was no attenuation of this association over the follow-up period,
      and the association was similar for the 22 clinical centers carrying out the
      screening. The gradient was seen for most of the specific causes of death,
      although the strength of the association varied. Median income was markedly lower
      for the Black men screened than for the White men, but the relationship between
      income and all-cause mortality was similar. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic position
      is an important determinant of mortality risk for Black men. Even though Blacks
      lived in areas with substantially lower median family income than Whites, the
      association of income with mortality was similar for Blacks and Whites.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined socioeconomic differentials in risk of death from
      a number of specific causes in a large cohort of White men in the United States. 
      METHODS: For 300 685 White men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
      Trial between 1973 and 1975, data were collected on median income of White
      households in the zip code of residence, age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, 
      serum cholesterol, previous myocardial infarction, and drug treatment for
      diabetes. The 31 737 deaths that occurred over the 16-year follow-up period were 
      grouped into specific causes and related to median White family income. RESULTS: 
      There was an inverse association between age- adjusted all-cause mortality and
      median family income. There was no attenuation of this association over the
      follow-up period, and the association was similar for the 22 clinical centers
      carrying out the screening. The gradient was seen for many-but not all-of the
      specific causes of death. Other risk factors accounted for some of the
      association between income and coronary heart disease and smoking-related
      cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic position, as measured by median family income
      of area of residence, is an important determinant of mortality risk in White men.

      Study. Lung Health Study Research Group.
PG  - 438-45
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess cardiovascular conditions and other side effects
      associated with the use of nicotine polacrilex (NP), 2 mg. DESIGN: A
      multicentered randomized control trial of early intervention for the prevention
      of COPD. SETTING: Ten university medical centers in the United States and Canada.
      PARTICIPANTS: Adult smoking volunteers with evidence of early COPD; 3,923 in
      intervention and 1,964 controls. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation program,
      including NP. MEASUREMENTS: Data on hospitalizations were collected annually.
      Data on reported NP side effects were collected at 4-month intervals for
      intervention participants. RESULTS: The rates of hospitalization for
      cardiovascular conditions and cardiovascular deaths during the 5 years of the
      study were not related to use of NP, to dose of NP, or to concomitant use of NP
      and cigarettes. About 25% of NP users reported at least one side effect, but most
      were very minor and transient. Side effects associated with discontinuance of NP 
      in 5% or more of users included headache, indigestion, mouth irritation, mouth
      ulcers, and nausea. There was no evidence that concomitant use of NP and
      cigarettes was associated with elevated rates of reported side effects.
      Participants in the smoking cessation intervention who received intensive levels 
      of instruction and monitoring of NP use (initially at 12 meetings during 3
      months) appeared to report significantly lower rates of side effects (dizziness, 
      headache, and throat irritation) than control participants, presumed to have less
      instruction and monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: NP, as used in the Lung Health Study,
      appears to be safe and unrelated to any cardiovascular illnesses or other serous 
      side effects.

TI  - Depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) and risk of invasive adenocarcinomas and
      adenosquamous carcinomas of the uterine cervix. WHO Collaborative Study of
      Neoplasia and Steroid Contraceptives.
PG  - 307-12
AB  - A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in two hospitals in Bangkok,
      Thailand, and in one hospital each in Chiang Mai, Thailand, Mexico City, Mexico
      and Nairobi, Kenya. One purpose of this study was to determine whether the
      long-acting progestational contraceptive, depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (DMPA), alters risk of invasive cervical carcinomas with adenomatous histological
      features. Information on prior use of DMPA, screening for cervical cancer, and
      the suspected risk factors for this disease was ascertained from interviews of
      239 women with adenocarcinomas and 85 women with adenosquamous carcinomas, as
      well of from a large pool of controls, 2534 of whom were matched to the cases
      included in this report. For selected subsets of these women, a smoking history
      was also elicited, blood specimens were collected for measurement of antibodies
      against herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus, and information on sexual behavior
      was obtained from interviews of their husbands. The relative risk (and 95%
      confidence interval) of adenomatous cervical carcinomas in women who ever used
      DMPA was estimated to be 0.75 (0.51, 1.11). No trends in risk were observed with 
      duration of DMPA use, times since first or last use, or age at first use. The
      results provide reassurance that use of DMPA for over four years does not enhance
      risk of adenomatous cervical carcinomas, and risk is not increased after a
      potential latent period of over 12 years since initial exposure.

TI  - Smoking cessation: a clinical study of the transdermal nicotine patch.
PG  - 655-6, 661-2
AB  - Although cigarette smoking is a declining trend in the United States, the amount 
      of cigarettes consumed by the American public is the same today as in 1964. The
      role of cigarette smoking in many disease processes is publicly well known, and
      smoking cessation has been proved to reduce risk for some diseases, but the
      various methods of cessation are often met with a high rate of treatment failure 
      or relapse. In this study, the short-term efficacy of nicotine-replacement
      therapy by way of the transdermal patch system was evaluated in 110 patients in a
      family practice setting. Patches were tapered from 21 mg of nicotine to 14 mg to 
      7 mg, each for 30 days. Subjects wore one patch for every 24 hours and were
      instructed not to smoke. Telephone follow-up was used at 2 to 3 weeks to check
      smoking status and inquire for side effects, and further follow-up of those who
      had completed the 3-month program was initiated 6 months after the program began.
      Nineteen patients never filled the prescription, and six were lost to follow-up. 
      Of the 85 who finished the program, 35% were still not smoking at 6 months after 
      the study began. The other 65% had relapsed. Side effects were mild and were
      mainly related to skin irritation at the patch site and abnormal dreams.
      Combinations of this cessation method with physician counseling and other
      behavioral methods should improve the success rate of this encouraging treatment.
