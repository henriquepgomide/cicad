TI  - Alcohol Policies and Suicide: A Review of the Literature.
LID - 10.1111/acer.13203 [doi]
AB  - Both intoxication and chronic heavy alcohol use are associated with suicide.
      There is extensive population-level evidence linking per capita alcohol
      consumption with suicide. While alcohol policies can reduce excessive alcohol
      consumption, the relationship between alcohol policies and suicide warrants a
      critical review of the literature. This review summarizes the associations
      between various types of alcohol policies and suicide, both in the United States 
      and internationally, as presented in English-language literature published
      between 1999 and 2014. Study designs, methodological challenges, and limitations 
      in ascertaining the associations are discussed. Because of the substantial
      between-states variation in alcohol policies, U.S.-based studies contributed
      substantially to the literature. Repeated cross-sectional designs at both the
      ecological level and decedent level were common among U.S.-based studies.
      Non-U.S. studies often used time series data to evaluate pre-post comparisons of 
      a hybrid set of policy changes. Although inconsistency remained, the published
      literature in general supported the protective effect of restrictive alcohol
      policies on reducing suicide as well as the decreased level of alcohol
      involvement among suicide decedents. Common limitations included measurement and 
      selection bias and a focus on effects of a limited number of alcohol policies
      without accounting for other alcohol policies. This review summarizes a number of
      studies that suggest restrictive alcohol policies may contribute to suicide
      prevention on a general population level and to a reduction of alcohol
      involvement among suicide deaths.

TI  - Association between cannabis use and treatment outcomes in patients receiving
      methadone maintenance treatment: a systematic review protocol.
PG  - 139
LID - 10.1186/s13643-016-0317-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the non-medical use of prescription opioids increasingly
      becoming a method of abuse in Canada, the number of patients requiring methadone 
      maintenance treatment (MMT) for opioid use disorder has increased dramatically.
      The rate of cannabis use in this population is disproportionately high (~50 %).
      Because its use is generally perceived as harmless, cannabis use is often not
      monitored during MMT. Current literature regarding the effects of cannabis use on
      MMT is conflicting, and the presence and nature of an association has not been
      clearly established. The primary objective of this review will be to conduct a
      systematic review of the literature and, if appropriate, a meta-analysis to
      determine whether there is an association between cannabis use and MMT outcomes. 
      A secondary objective will be to perform subgroup analyses (by age, sex, method
      of cannabis measurement, and country) to determine whether cannabis use
      differentially influences MMT outcomes within these subgroups. METHODS/DESIGN:
      The search will be conducted on the following electronic databases using a
      predefined search strategy: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Two authors (LZ and MB) will
      independently screen articles using predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria
      and will extract data from included articles using a pilot-tested data extraction
      form. Disagreements at all stages of the screening process will be settled
      through discussion, and when consensus cannot be reached, a third author (ZS)
      will be consulted. An assessment of quality and risk of bias will be conducted on
      all included articles, and a sensitivity analysis will be used to compare results
      of studies with high and low risk of bias. We will perform random- and
      fixed-effects meta-analyses, if appropriate, with heterogeneity calculated using 
      the I (2) statistic and formal evaluation of publication bias. DISCUSSION:
      Results of this systematic review will elucidate the association between cannabis
      use and methadone maintenance treatment outcomes. We will provide evidence that
      will be useful to clinicians regarding whether monitoring cannabis use during MMT
      is advantageous for optimizing MMT outcomes. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - Diagnosis and Treatment of Alcoholic Hepatitis: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 1390-402
LID - 10.1111/acer.13108 [doi]
AB  - Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) occurs in about one-third of individuals reporting
      long-term heavy alcohol use. It is associated with high short-term mortality,
      economic burden, and hospital resources utilization. We performed this systematic
      review to (i) describe clinical characteristics and genomics associated with the 
      risk of AH; (ii) discuss role and limitations of liver biopsy and prognostic
      scoring systems; (iii) summarize evidence regarding the currently available
      therapies including liver transplantation; and (iv) outline emerging therapies
      with areas of unmet need. Literature search was performed for studies published
      in English language (January 1971 through March 2016). The following search
      engines were used: PubMed, Elsevier Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library. For
      the treatment section, only randomized controlled studies were included for this 
      review. A total of 138 studies (59 randomized, 22 systematic reviews or
      meta-analyses, 7 surveys or guidelines, 7 population-based, and 43 prospective
      cohorts) were cited. There are over 325,000 annual admissions with AH
      contributing to about 0.8% of all hospitalizations in the United States. Liver
      biopsy may be required in about 25 to 30% cases for uncertain clinical diagnosis.
      Corticosteroids with or without N-acetylcysteine remains the only available
      therapy for severe episodes. Data are emerging on the role of liver
      transplantation as salvage therapy for select patients. Abstinence remains the
      most important factor impacting long-term prognosis. Results from the ongoing
      clinical trials within the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
      Alcoholism-funded consortia are awaited for more effective and safer therapies.
      AH is a potentially lethal condition with a significant short-term mortality. A
      high index of suspicion is required. There remains an unmet need for noninvasive 
      biomarkers for the diagnosis, and predicting prognosis and response to therapy.

TI  - What Is the Prevalence of Symptomatic Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome in Chronic
      Spinal Pain Patients? An Assessment of the Correlation of OSAS with Chronic
      Opioid Therapy, Obesity, and Smoking.
PG  - E569-79
AB  - BACKGROUND: In modern medicine, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a
      commonly described sleep disorder with airway obstruction, disrupted sleep, and
      excessive daytime sleepiness. Since its description in 1976 by Guilleminault et
      al, numerous epidemiologic studies and systematic reviews, with multiple
      comorbidities related to cardiovascular sequelae, altered cognitive function, and
      multiple other potential complications have been described. Multiple risk factors
      have been identified included obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and other
      factors. Chronic pain and chronic opioid therapy also have been described to
      contribute to a large proportion of patients with OSAS. Chronic pain, obesity,
      smoking, and chronic opioid therapy are often found together, yet there is a
      paucity of literature describing OSAS in chronic pain patients. OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the prevalence of symptomatic OSAS in chronic spinal pain patients
      receiving chronic opioid therapy and determine the association of OSAS with
      multiple risk factors and comorbidities. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective assessment
      of patients who attend a single interventional pain management practice from
      January 1, 2010to December 31, 2014. SETTING: A private interventional pain
      management practice in the United States. METHODS: The data were collected from
      4,036 consecutive patients presenting for assessment to a pain management center 
      from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2014. All assessments were comprehensive and
      performed by 2 physicians. The comprehensive assessment included a complete
      history, a physical examination, and a review of records. RESULTS: The prevalence
      of OSAS in patients with chronic spinal pain was 13.8%. The results showed a
      higher prevalence in males compared to females (15.1% versus 12.8%), a higher
      prevalence in those aged 45 or older compared to those 25-45 years and those
      18-25 years (16.3% versus 10.7% or 2.5%), higher prevalence in Hispanics and
      Asians compared to African Americans and whites (23.7% versus 16.2% versus
      13.4%), higher prevalence in patients with combined back and neck pain compared
      to patients with thoracic pain only or back pain only (16.3% versus 8.2% to 11%).
      Prevalence also varied by body mass index (BMI): 32.4% in morbidly obese
      patients, 20.3% in severely obese patients, 15.7% in obese patients, 9.2% in
      those who were overweight, and only 5.7% in those with normal weight. A
      significant correlation with OSAS was also observed in patients smoking more than
      40 pack years and multiple respiratory symptoms except for chronic bronchitis and
      multiple cardiovascular ailments. LIMITATIONS: The retrospective nature of the
      assessment. CONCLUSION: This retrospective assessment of over 4,000 patients
      suffering from chronic pain and receiving chronic opioid therapy indicated a
      prevalence of sleep apnea syndrome as 13.8%. Multiple risk factors including
      obesity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic sinus and nasal
      discharge, and multiple comorbidities including cardiovascular and related
      ailments have been identified. KEY WORDS: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome,
      chronic pain, chronic spinal pain, chronic opioid therapy, obesity, smoking,
      cardiovascular risk factors, pulmonary risk factors.

BTI - Screening for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Systematic Evidence Review
      for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death 
      in the United States. We conducted this systematic review to support the U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force in updating its recommendation on screening for
      COPD. Our review addressed eight questions: 1) Does screening for COPD in
      asymptomatic adults age 40 years and older with prebronchodilator spirometry
      improve health-related quality of life or reduce morbidity or mortality? 2) Do
      prescreening questionnaires reliably identify high-risk asymptomatic adults who
      are more likely to test positive on screening for COPD? 3) What is the test
      performance of screening pulmonary function tests in predicting diagnosis of COPD
      in asymptomatic adults, based on confirmation with postbronchodilator spirometry 
      to identify fixed airflow obstruction? 4) What are the adverse effects of
      screening for COPD with prescreening questionnaires or screening pulmonary
      function tests? 5) Does identifying asymptomatic adults with fixed airflow
      obstruction through screening improve the delivery and uptake of targeted
      preventive services? 6) What are the adverse effects of COPD screening, including
      the impact of targeted preventive services in this population? 7) Does treatment 
      of asymptomatic adults identified with mild to moderate COPD through screening
      improve health-related quality of life or reduce morbidity or mortality? 8) What 
      are the adverse effects of COPD treatment in this population? We searched
      MEDLINE, PubMed Publisher-Supplied Records, and the Cochrane Collaboration
      Registry of Controlled Trials to identify literature published from January 2000 
      or 2005 through January 2015, depending on key question. We supplemented our
      searches with reference lists from the previous review, relevant existing
      systematic reviews, suggestions from experts, and Clinicaltrials.gov to identify 
      ongoing trials. Two investigators independently reviewed identified abstracts and
      full-text articles against a set of a priori inclusion and quality criteria. One 
      investigator abstracted data into an evidence table and a second investigator
      checked these data. We qualitatively synthesized the data for each key question; 
      quantitative synthesis was not appropriate due to heterogeneity and few trials
      for any given intervention and outcome. We identified three externally validated 
      COPD questionnaires, the COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire (CDQ), the Lung Function
      Questionnaire, and the COPD Population Screener. The CDQ, an eight-item
      self-administered, symptom- and risk factor-based questionnaire, was externally
      validated in two good- and three fair-quality diagnostic accuracy studies
      (n=3,048). Validation populations recruited exclusively or at least partly from
      primary care practices, excluding participants with known lung disease, and most 
      studies recruited at least half of their participants with a smoking history.
      Most external validation studies reported that a CDQ score of greater than 16.5
      had a sensitivity in the low 90 percent range and specificity in the high-30 to
      mid-40 percent range for diagnosing spirometrically-confirmed COPD. The Lung
      Function Questionnaire, a five-item self-administered, risk factor- and
      symptom-based questionnaire, was externally validated in one fair-quality
      multicenter primary care study (n=1,288) in the United States of ever smokers
      with at least a 10 pack-year exposure. The study reported a high rate of
      unacceptable spirometry (31%), as well as an estimated sensitivity of 88 percent 
      and specificity of 25 percent. The COPD Population Screener, a five-item
      self-administered, risk factor- and symptom-based questionnaire, was externally
      validated in a single fair-quality population-based study (n=2,357) in a rural
      Japanese town and reported a sensitivity of 67 percent and specificity of 73
      percent. We identified two fair-quality Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease
      population-based studies of prebronchodilator peak flow. These studies used
      different index test and gold standard thresholds for defining COPD in both low- 
      and high-index countries without exclusion of known COPD; these studies do not
      provide sufficient information to make conclusions regarding peak flow screening 
      accuracy. We identified one good- and one fair-quality study of prebronchodilator
      microspirometry measuring the ratio of forced expiratory flow in 1 second to
      forced expiratory flow in 6 seconds (FEV1/FEV6) and reporting consistent
      sensitivities in the low 50 percent range and specificities in the 90 percent
      range. We identified one fair-quality study of postbronchodilator microspirometry
      measuring FEV1/FEV6 in a population of approximately half ever smokers, which
      reported a higher sensitivity (80%) and specificity (95%). One fair-quality study
      examined a staged approach whereby the screening test was considered positive
      only if both the CDQ and FEV1/FEV6 tests were positive. Sensitivity and
      specificity were 72 and 97 percent, respectively, in the entire population and
      similar in a subset of smokers only. Evidence of screening harms from diagnostic 
      accuracy studies was limited; only false positives and false negatives associated
      with screening were reported, and few studies reported data for the calculation
      of number of missed cases. We identified five randomized, controlled trials
      (RCTs) (n=1,620) addressing the effectiveness of COPD screening in influencing
      smoking cessation rates. Of the three RCTs reporting biochemically confirmed
      abstinence, only one fair-quality U.K. primary care-based RCT (n=561) reported a 
      statistically significant difference in smoking cessation at 1 year, with a
      number needed to treat of 14; this trial measured the incremental value of adding
      "lung age" to standardized counseling. The other two underpowered RCTs of
      biochemically validated abstinence reported no difference or a nonstatistically
      significant trend favoring reduction in the spirometry group. No studies examined
      the effectiveness of screening to increase vaccination rates. There were no
      treatment trials identified in screen-detected patients; thus, we included trials
      with either subanalyses of participants with mild to moderate COPD or trials in
      which the mean FEV1 percent predicted was 60 percent or greater. We identified a 
      total of one good- and 13 fair-quality RCTs meeting these criteria providing
      analysis of mild to moderate COPD patients; two long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)
      studies (n=3,174), one inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-LABA combination study
      (n=1,097), five tiotropium studies (n=4,592), and six ICS studies (n=3,983).
      Overall, subanalyses were limited due to post hoc timing, underpowering for
      subgroups, lack of data to confirm baseline comparability for the subgroup, lack 
      of interaction testing, and lack of control for confounders. However, available
      subanalyses suggest no benefit in all-cause mortality but a decrease in annual
      rate of exacerbations with LABAs, LABA-ICS, tiotropium, and ICS. Because absolute
      rates of exacerbations were less than 1 in patients with mild to moderate COPD,
      the clinical magnitude of this benefit is uncertain. Data were too limited to
      make conclusions regarding other patient-focused outcomes (e.g., exercise
      capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life). We identified eight effectiveness RCTs
      reporting harms data, but few trials reported harms for any individual drug
      class, making conclusions about treatment-related adverse events challenging.
      Concerns about pneumonia and bone demineralization with ICS medications could not
      be confirmed because few trials reported these outcomes. U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration drug labels for the considered drug classes report side effects as
      generally mild, ranging from dry mouth and coughing to vomiting and pneumonia.
      There is no direct evidence to quantify the benefits and harms of COPD screening 
      with questionnaires or handheld spirometry, nor is there evidence to estimate the
      treatment benefits in screen-detected populations. The evidence gaps identified
      in this systematic review suggest that there is a need for future research
      examining the treatment benefit in asymptomatic screen-detected populations or
      populations with mild disease.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading
      cause of death in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review
      literature on the accuracy of screening questionnaires and office-based screening
      pulmonary function testing and the efficacy and harms of treatment of
      screen-detected COPD. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials for relevant English-language studies published
      through January 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers independently screened
      abstracts and studies. The search yielded 13,141 unique citations; 465 full-text 
      articles were reviewed, and 33 studies met the inclusion criteria. DATA
      EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers rated the quality of each study using
      USPSTF criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], and negative predictive value
      [NPV]; treatment efficacy (COPD exacerbations, all-cause mortality, quality of
      life, and dyspnea); and treatment harms. RESULTS: All screening questionnaires
      were based on symptoms as well as risk factors such as age and smoking history.
      The COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire was the most extensively studied (5 studies, n 
      = 3048), with moderate overall performance for COPD detection: area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), 0.65 to 0.72; sensitivity, 80% to 
      93%; and specificity, 24% to 49%, at a threshold of greater than 16.5. Positive
      predictive value and NPV ranged from 17% to 45% and 76% to 98%, respectively. For
      pulmonary function-based screening tools, FEV1/FEV6 was the best studied (3
      studies, n = 1587), with AUC ranging from 0.84 to 0.85. Sensitivity ranged from
      51% to 80%. Specificity (range, 90%-95%) and PPV (range, 63%-75%) appeared better
      than questionnaires. There was not strong evidence to support that screening and 
      supplying smokers with spirometry results improves smoking cessation rates.
      Treatment trials were unavailable for screen-detected patients. Trials that
      reported outcomes in patients with mild to moderate COPD included 2 trials of
      long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) (n = 3174), 1 RCT of LABAs and inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) (n = 1097), 5 RCTs of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist
      tiotropium (n = 4592), and 6 RCTs of ICS (n = 3983). They suggested no benefit in
      all-cause mortality, but a decrease in annual rates of exacerbations with
      pharmacologic treatments. Few trials reported harms for any individual drug
      class. Adverse effects were generally mild (eg, dry mouth and cough). CONCLUSIONS
      AND RELEVANCE: There was no direct evidence available to determine the benefits
      and harms of screening asymptomatic adults for COPD using questionnaires or
      office-based screening pulmonary function testing or to determine the benefits of
      treatment in screen-detected populations. Indirect evidence suggests that the
      COPD Diagnostic Questionnaire has moderate overall performance for COPD
      detection. Among patients with mild to moderate COPD, the benefit of
      pharmacotherapy for reducing exacerbations was modest.

TI  - Effectiveness of an Electronic Booster Session Delivered to Mandated Students.
PG  - 123-9

AB  - College student drinking continues to be a problem in the United States. Students
      who have violated campus alcohol policy are at particularly high risk for
      dangerous drinking. While Brief Alcohol Screening and Intervention for College
      Students (BASICS) has been found to be an effective strategy in reducing
      high-risk drinking and associated consequences, questions remain about ways to
      further reduce risk or sustain changes associated with a face-to face
      intervention. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a
      computer-delivered personalized feedback (electronic booster) delivered to policy
      violators who completed a mandated BASICS program. At 3-month post-intervention, 
      346 participants (60.4% male and 39.6% female) were randomized to one of two
      conditions: assessment only (n = 171) or electronic booster feedback (n = 175).
      Follow-up assessments were given to all participants at 3, 6, and 12-month
      post-initial intervention. Both groups showed reductions in drinking after the
      in-person BASICS intervention, but no additional reductions were seen with the
      addition of an electronic booster session. Findings suggest that although brief
      motivational interventions delivered in person to mandated students have been
      shown to be effective with mandated students, there is no additional benefit from
      an electronic booster session delivered 3-month post-intervention for this
      population.

TI  - Binge drinking is associated with differences in weekday and weekend adherence in
      HIV-infected individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding patterns of antiretroviral adherence and its predictors
      is important for designing tailored interventions. Alcohol use is associated with
      non-adherence. This study aimed to evaluate: (1) if there was a difference in
      weekday compared with weekend adherence in HIV-infected individuals from low and 
      middle income countries (LMIC), and (2) whether binge drinking was associated
      with this difference. METHODS: Data from a randomized trial conducted at 9 sites 
      in 8 LMIC were analyzed. Microelectronic monitors were used to measure adherence.
      Differences between weekday and weekend adherence in each quarter (successive
      12-week periods) were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests and predictors of
      adherence, including baseline binge drinking, were evaluated using Generalized
      Estimating Equations. RESULTS: Data from 255 participants were analyzed: 49.8%
      were male, median age was 37 years and 28.6% enrolled in Haiti. At study entry,
      only 2.7% reported illicit substance use, but 22.3% reported binge drinking at
      least once in the 30 days prior to enrollment. Adherence was higher on weekdays
      than weekends (median percent doses taken: 96.0% vs 94.4%; 93.7% vs 91.7%; 92.6% 
      vs 89.7% and 93.7% vs 89.7% in quarters 1-4 respectively, all p<0.001). Binge
      drinking at baseline and time on study were both associated with greater
      differences between weekday and weekend adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was
      worse on weekends compared to weekdays: difference was small at treatment
      initiation, increased over time and was associated with binge drinking. Screening
      and new interventions to address binge drinking, a potentially modifiable
      behavior, may improve adherence in HIV-infected individuals in LMIC.

TI  - Alcohol withdrawal management in adult patients in a high acuity medical surgical
      transitional care unit: a best practice implementation project.
PG  - 314-34
LID - 10.11124/jbisrir-2015-2529 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption, a major health problem worldwide,
      affects about 6% of the United States population. Caring for patients with
      alcohol withdrawal syndrome in a hospital ward presents complex physiologic and
      psycho-social challenges which are best met with evidence-based practices. An
      academic medical center in the United States has been experiencing an increase in
      patients with alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, gaps in clinician knowledge
      and infrastructure supporting the management of these patients still existed.
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this project was to improve the continuity of care of
      patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal in a medical surgical high acuity
      transitional care unit by incorporating evidence-based practices, and thereby to 
      positively impact on patient outcomes. Specific objectives were related to
      standardized assessments and pharmacologic management strategies. METHODS: The
      project used the Joanna Briggs Institute's Practical Application of Clinical
      Evidence System and Getting Research into Practice audit tool for promoting
      change in health practice. A baseline clinical audit was conducted to assess
      compliance with best practices for managing alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which
      was followed by several interventions targeted at nurses and providers. A
      follow-up audit was conducted to assess compliance with the implemented
      strategies. The follow-up audit used the same evidence-based audit criteria as
      those used for the baseline audit. A non-probabilistic, convenience sampling
      approach was used. A sample size of 15 patients was used for both the baseline
      and follow-up audits. RESULTS: The baseline audit revealed a high compliance rate
      for four of the five audit criteria concerning risk assessment and pharmacologic 
      strategies. There was sub-optimal compliance (53%) with the criterion regarding
      use of the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (revised)
      (CIWA-Ar) scale to assess patients with alcohol withdrawal. After the
      interventions were implemented this criterion recorded an improvement to 100%
      compliance. None of the patients in the pilot were transferred to the intensive
      care unit (ICU) for reasons relating to alcohol withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: The
      outcomes of this project demonstrated alcohol withdrawal management can be safely
      undertaken outside the ICU when the patients are appropriately assessed and
      treated for the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. This new clinical program 
      significantly impacted on continuity of care. Challenges were resolved using an
      interdisciplinary team approach. The project resulted in plans for further areas 
      of work concerning alcohol withdrawal management, including adoption of similar
      approaches by other acute and transitional care units.

TI  - Indicated Prevention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in South Africa:
      Effectiveness of Case Management.

AB  - In the Western Cape Province of South Africa (ZA) a subculture of binge drinking 
      produces the highest global documented prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum
      disorders (FASD). FASD prevention research activities in ZA use the Comprehensive
      Prevention approach from the United States Institute of Medicine. Case management
      (CM) was delivered as a method of indicated prevention to empower heavy drinking 
      pregnant women to achieve cessation or a reduction in drinking. CM activities
      incorporated life management, Motivational Interviewing (MI) techniques and the
      Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA). Data were collected at baseline, 6, 12
      and 18 months. Mean drinking decreases 6 months into CM; but overall alcohol
      consumption rose significantly over time to levels higher than baseline at 12 and
      18 months. Alcohol consumption drops significantly from before pregnancy to the
      second and third trimesters. AUDIT scores indicate that problematic drinking
      decreases significantly even after the vulnerable fetus/baby was born. CM
      significantly increases client happiness, which correlates with reduced weekend
      drinking. CM was successful for women with high-risk drinking behaviour, and was 
      effective in helping women stop drinking, or drink less, while pregnant, reducing
      the risk of FASD.

PG  - 134-51
LID - 10.3322/caac.21334 [doi]
AB  - People with mental illness die decades earlier in the United States compared with
      the general population. Most of this disparity is related to preventable and
      treatable chronic conditions, with many studies finding cancer as the second
      leading cause of death. Individual lifestyle factors, such as smoking or limited 
      adherence to treatment, are often cited as highly significant issues in shaping
      risk among persons with mental illness. However, many contextual or systems-level
      factors exacerbate these individual factors and may fundamentally drive health
      disparities among people with mental illness. The authors conducted an
      integrative review to summarize the empirical literature on cancer prevention,
      screening, and treatment for people with mental illness. Although multiple
      interventions are being developed and tested to address tobacco dependence and
      obesity in these populations, the evidence for effectiveness is quite limited,
      and essentially all prevention interventions focus at the individual level. This 
      review identified only one published article describing evidence-based
      interventions to promote cancer screening and improve cancer treatment in people 
      with mental illness. On the basis of a literature review and the experience and
      expertise of the authors, each section in this article concludes with suggestions
      at the individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, and policy levels
      that may improve cancer prevention, screening, and treatment in people with
      mental illness.

TI  - Prevalence and Correlates of Client-Perpetrated Violence against Female Sex
      Workers in 13 Mexican Cities.
PG  - e0143317
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0143317 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, client-perpetrated violence against female sex workers
      (FSWs) has been associated with multiple health-related harms, including
      high-risk sexual behavior and increased exposure to HIV/STIs. This study examined
      correlates of client-perpetrated sexual, physical, and economic violence (e.g.,
      robbery) against FSWs in 13 cities throughout Mexico. METHODS: FSWs (N = 1,089)
      who were enrolled in a brief, evidence-based, sexual risk reduction intervention 
      for FSWs (Mujer Segura) were interviewed about their work context, including
      experiences of violence perpetrated by clients, sexual risk and substance use
      practices, financial need, and social supports. Three broad categories of factors
      (sociodemographic, work context, behavioral and social characteristics of FSWs)
      were examined as correlates of sexual, physical, and economic violence. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of different types of client-perpetrated violence against FSWs in 
      the past 6 months was: sexual (11.7%), physical (11.8%), economic (16.9%), and
      any violence (22.6%). Greater financial need, self-identification as a street
      worker, and lower perceived emotional support were independently associated with 
      all three types of violence. Alcohol use before or during sex with clients in the
      past month was associated with physical and sexual violence. Using drugs before
      or during sex with clients, injection drug use in the past month, and population 
      size of city were associated with sexual violence only, and FSWs' alcohol use
      score (AUDIT-C) was associated with economic violence only. CONCLUSIONS:
      Correlates of client-perpetrated violence encompassed sociodemographic, work
      context, and behavioral and social factors, suggesting that approaches to
      violence prevention for FSWs must be multi-dimensional. Prevention could involve 
      teaching FSWs strategies for risk avoidance in the workplace (e.g., avoiding use 
      of alcohol with clients), enhancement of FSWs' community-based supports,
      development of interventions that deliver an anti-violence curriculum to clients,
      and programs to address FSWs' financial need by increasing their economic
      opportunities outside of the sex trade.

TI  - Efficacy of CPC and essential oils mouthwashes compared to a negative control
      mouthwash in controlling established dental plaque and gingivitis: A 6-week,
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 21A-6A
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the clinical efficacy of a mouthwash containing 0.075%
      cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in a fluoride-free, alcohol-free base and a
      mouthwash containing essential oils in a fluoride-free, 21.6% alcohol base as
      compared to a fluoride-free, alcohol-free non-antibacterial mouthwash in
      controlling established dental plaque and gingivitis after 6 weeks of twice daily
      use. METHODS: A 6-week, parallel-group, randomized double blind clinical trial
      was conducted in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Recruited subjects were
      randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: (1) a mouthwash containing
      0.075% CPC in a fluoride-free, alcohol-free base (CPC); (2) a
      commercially-available mouthwash containing essential oils in a fluoride-free,
      21.6% alcohol base (EO); or (3) a fluoride-free, alcohol-free non-antibacterial
      mouthwash (NC). Subjects were instructed to rinse with the assigned mouthwash,
      after tooth brushing, twice daily (morning and evening). After 4 and 6 weeks of
      product use, subjects were examined for gingivitis (Whole Mouth Gingival,
      Gingival Interproximal, Gingival Severity Indexes) and plaque (Whole Mouth
      Plaque, Plaque Interproximal, and Plaque Severity Indexes) parameters. For
      treatment group comparisons, ANCOVA and post hoc Tukey's pair-wise comparisons
      (alpha = 0.05) were performed. RESULTS: 132 subjects were screened; 120 were
      enrolled; and 116 completed the study. After 6 weeks of product use, subjects
      using the CPC and EO mouthwashes exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.001) 
      reductions of all gingival and plaque measurements compared to subjects using the
      NC mouthwash. Subjects using the CPC mouthwash did not exhibit a statistically
      significant (P > 0.05) reduction with respect to gingival severity and all plaque
      measures (Whole, Interproximal, and Severity) when compared to EO mouthwash.
      Subjects using the CPC mouthwash exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.05)
      reductions in Gingival Index scores of 5.1% (P = 0.005), and Gingival
      Interproximal Index scores of 5.5% (P = 0.016) relative to subjects using the EO 
      mouthwash. These reductions were not considered clinically significant.

TI  - Statewide Administration of the CRAFFT Screening Tool: Highlighting the Spectrum 
      of Substance Use.
PG  - 1668-77
LID - 10.3109/10826084.2015.1027930 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adolescent alcohol and drug use in the United States are associated
      with negative consequences spanning multiple domains. Much of the public health
      surveillance of these behaviors relies on self-report survey data. These data
      frequently takes the form of frequency or prevalence data for specific
      substances, which may not provide a complete picture of use. OBJECTIVES: This
      study analyzes a state-level survey that includes the CRAFFT screening tool. The 
      study's goal is to elucidate the spectrum of substance use severity across a
      large segment of substance-using adolescents attending schools in the state of
      Indiana and to assess the contribution of a variety of predictor variables to the
      variance between users falling into each category of use severity. METHODS: Data 
      were collected in 2011 from 168,801 adolescents, of whom 25,204 met the inclusion
      criteria for this study. The authors utilize multinomial logit analyses to
      highlight variables, including sociodemographic data, poly-drug use, and
      risk/protective behavior scales, associated with each category of use. RESULTS:
      Seriousness of use is not uniform across substance-using adolescents; 49% were
      categorized as nonproblem users, 33% as problem users, and 18% as dependent
      users. Risk and protective factors predict adolescents' severity of substance
      use, but do not do so uniformly. Poly-drug use is a significant predictor of
      problem use and dependent use as well. CONCLUSIONS: The CRAFFT may provide a more
      nuanced perspective of adolescent substance use than frequency/prevalence data
      alone; the authors describe the implications derived from these data and analyses
      to the adolescent prevention and treatment systems.

TI  - Kidney-Failure Risk Projection for the Living Kidney-Donor Candidate.
PG  - 411-21
LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa1510491 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of candidates to serve as living kidney donors relies on
      screening for individual risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). To
      support an empirical approach to donor selection, we developed a tool that
      simultaneously incorporates multiple health characteristics to estimate a
      person's probable long-term risk of ESRD if that person does not donate a kidney.
      METHODS: We used risk associations from a meta-analysis of seven general
      population cohorts, calibrated to the population-level incidence of ESRD and
      mortality in the United States, to project the estimated long-term incidence of
      ESRD among persons who do not donate a kidney, according to 10 demographic and
      health characteristics. We then compared 15-year projections with the observed
      risk among 52,998 living kidney donors in the United States. RESULTS: A total of 
      4,933,314 participants from seven cohorts were followed for a median of 4 to 16
      years. For a 40-year-old person with health characteristics that were similar to 
      those of age-matched kidney donors, the 15-year projections of the risk of ESRD
      in the absence of donation varied according to race and sex; the risk was 0.24%
      among black men, 0.15% among black women, 0.06% among white men, and 0.04% among 
      white women. Risk projections were higher in the presence of a lower estimated
      glomerular filtration rate, higher albuminuria, hypertension, current or former
      smoking, diabetes, and obesity. In the model-based lifetime projections, the risk
      of ESRD was highest among persons in the youngest age group, particularly among
      young blacks. The 15-year observed risks after donation among kidney donors in
      the United States were 3.5 to 5.3 times as high as the projected risks in the
      absence of donation. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple demographic and health characteristics
      may be used together to estimate the projected long-term risk of ESRD among
      living kidney-donor candidates and to inform acceptance criteria for kidney
      donors. (Funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney

TI  - Pricing of alcohol in Canada: A comparison of provincial policies and
      harm-reduction opportunities.
PG  - 289-97
LID - 10.1111/dar.12338 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Alcohol pricing is an effective prevention policy. This
      paper compares the 10 Canadian provinces on three research-based alcohol pricing 
      policies-minimum pricing, pricing by alcohol content and maintaining prices
      relative to inflation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The selection of these three policies 
      was based on systematic reviews and seminal research papers. Provincial data for 
      2012 were obtained from Statistics Canada and relevant provincial ministries,
      subsequently sent to provincial authorities for verification, and then scored by 
      team members. RESULTS: All provinces, except for Alberta, have minimum prices for
      at least one beverage type sold in off-premise outlets. All provinces, except for
      British Columbia and Quebec, have separate (and higher) minimum pricing for
      on-premise establishments. Regarding pricing on alcohol content, western and
      central provinces typically scored higher than provinces in Eastern Canada.
      Generally, minimum prices were lower than the recommended $1.50 per standard
      drink for off-premise outlets and $3.00 per standard drink in on-premise venues. 
      Seven of 10 provinces scored 60% or higher compared to the ideal on indexing
      prices to inflation. Prices for a representative basket of alcohol products in
      Ontario and Quebec have lagged significantly behind inflation since 2006.
      DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: While examples of evidence-based alcohol pricing
      policies can be found in every jurisdiction in Canada, significant
      inter-provincial variation leaves substantial unrealised potential for further
      reducing alcohol-related harm and costs. This comparative assessment of alcohol
      price policies provides clear indications of how individual provinces could
      adjust their pricing policies and practices to improve public health and safety.

TI  - Clinical impact of alcohol-related cirrhosis in the next decade: estimates based 
      on current epidemiological trends in the United States.
PG  - 2085-94
LID - 10.1111/acer.12887 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying changes in the epidemiology of liver disease is critical 
      for establishing healthcare priorities and allocating resources to develop
      therapies. The projected contribution of different etiologies toward development 
      of cirrhosis in the United States was estimated based on current publications on 
      epidemiological data and advances in therapy. Given the heterogeneity of
      published reports and the different perceptions that are not always reconcilable,
      a critical overview rather than a formal meta-analysis of the existing data and
      projections for the next decade was performed. METHODS: Data from the World
      Health Organization Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health of 2014,
      Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from 1999 to 2012, National
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention were inquired to determine future changes in the epidemiology of
      liver disease. RESULTS: Alcohol consumption has increased over the past 60 years.
      In 2010, transplant-related costs for liver recipients were the highest for
      hepatitis C (~$124 million) followed by alcohol-related cirrhosis (~$86 million).
      We anticipate a significant reduction in incidence cirrhosis due to causes other 
      than alcohol because of the availability of high efficiency antiviral agents for 
      hepatitis C, universal and effective vaccination for hepatitis B, relative
      stabilization of the obesity trends in the United States, and novel, potentially 
      effective therapies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The proportion of
      alcohol-related liver disease is therefore likely to increase in both the
      population as a whole and the liver transplant wait list. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alcohol-related cirrhosis and alcohol-related liver disorders will be the major
      cause of liver disease in the coming decades. There is an urgent need to allocate
      resources aimed toward understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and its
      complications so that effective therapies can be developed.

      Adults, Including Pregnant Women: A Review of Reviews for the U.S. Preventive
      Services Task Force
AB  - Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in
      the United States. Interventions to help adults quit smoking might stop or reduce
      tobacco-related illness. To systematically review evidence for the effectiveness 
      and safety of pharmacotherapy and behavioral tobacco cessation interventions
      among adults, including pregnant women and those with mental health conditions,
      and to conduct a de novo search for primary evidence related to electronic
      nicotine delivery systems for adults. We conducted a review of reviews and
      searched for existing systematic reviews published through August 1, 2014 in the 
      following databases and organizations' websites: PubMed, PsycInfo, the Database
      of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
      the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination Health Technology Assessment, the Agency
      of Healthcare Research and Quality, British Medical Journal Clinical Evidence,
      the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, Center for Disease
      Control and Prevention's Guide to Community Preventive Services, the Institute of
      Medicine, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, the National
      Health Service Health Technology Assessment Programme, and the Surgeon General.
      We included reviews that were published in the English language that
      systematically reported the effects of tobacco cessation interventions on health,
      cessation, or adverse outcomes. We excluded nonsystematic meta-analyses and
      narrative reviews and those that focused on harm reduction or relapse prevention.
      We conducted an a priori search for primary trial evidence related to the
      effectiveness and safety of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) (through 
      March 1, 2015) and a search for pharmacotherapy among pregnant women (through
      August 15, 2014) to supplement the review of reviews methodology. Two
      investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles against a
      set of a priori inclusion and quality criteria. Discrepancies were resolved by
      consensus. One reviewer abstracted data into an evidence table and a second
      reviewer checked these data. We grouped reviews based on population (general
      adults, pregnant women, individuals with mental health conditions) and
      intervention (pharmacotherapy, behavioral, or combined interventions). We
      identified one or more reviews within each population and intervention subgroup
      that represented the most current and applicable evidence to serve as the basis
      for the main findings ("primary" reviews) and discussed complementary and
      discordant findings from other included reviews as necessary. We did not
      reanalyze any of the individual study evidence; we presented pooled analyses and 
      existing point estimates from included reviews. We included 54 systematic
      reviews, 22 of which served as the basis for the primary findings. Among adults, 
      nine reviews addressed the efficacy and/or harms of nicotine replacement therapy 
      (NRT), bupropion hydrochloride sustained release (bupropion SR), and/or
      varenicline. None of these reviews reported on health outcomes. All three
      medications were found to be effective in increasing smoking quit rates compared 
      with placebo or nondrug arms at 6 or more months followup. The pooled risk ratio 
      (RR) for abstinence for NRT was 1.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.53 to
      1.68); for bupropion SR, RR 1.62 (95% CI, 1.49 to 1.76); and for varenicline,
      2.27 (95% CI, 2.02 to 2.55). Combined NRT versus a single form of NRT showed a
      statistically significantly greater cessation effect in pooled analysis (RR 1.34 
      [95% CI, 1.18 to 1.51]). None of the drugs were associated with major
      cardiovascular adverse events, although NRT produced higher rates of all
      cardiovascular events (driven by minor events). One review on combined
      pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions reported a relative increase in
      quitting by 82 percent versus nonpharmacotherapy usual care (RR 1.82 [95% CI,
      1.66 to 2.00]). We included an additional 33 reviews that addressed behavioral
      tobacco cessation treatments among adults, including those that focused on
      specific subpopulations such as older adults. Compared with various controls,
      behavioral interventions such as in-person advice and support from clinicians,
      self-help materials, and telephone counseling had modest, but significantly
      increased, relative smoking cessation at 6 or more months (18% to 96%). For
      example, the pooled RR of physician advice versus no advice was 1.76 (95% CI,
      1.58 to 1.96) for smoking cessation at 6 or more months followup. Only two trials
      addressed the efficacy and harms related to the use of electronic cigarettes and 
      these trials suggested no benefit on smoking cessation among smokers intending to
      quit. We included eight reviews that focused on pregnant women that found
      significant benefits for perinatal health, including increased birth weight and
      reduced preterm birth. These benefits were evident with behavioral interventions,
      and suggested by data from some of the NRT trials, although that evidence was
      limited. Cessation during late pregnancy was greater among women receiving any
      type of behavioral intervention, with evidence most clear for counseling. Rates
      of validated cessation among women allocated to NRT (5% to 24%) compared with
      placebo (0% to 15%) were not statistically different, although few studies
      contributed data. Our reviews among individuals with depression or schizophrenia 
      provided limited trial evidence on the efficacy of pharmacotherapy or behavioral 
      interventions. There was, however, some evidence of a benefit for bupropion among
      those with schizophrenia and the addition of a mood management component to
      behavioral interventions for smokers with depression. This review of reviews
      suggests that behavioral interventions and pharmacotherapy, alone or in
      combination, are effective in helping to reduce rates of smoking among the
      general adult population. Behavioral interventions, in particular, can assist
      pregnant women to stop smoking. Data on the effectiveness and safety of
      electronic nicotine delivery systems are limited. Future research should focus on
      direct comparisons between different combinations and classes of drugs; the
      incidence of serious adverse events related to medications for cessation; the
      efficacy and safety of ENDS; and pharmacotherapies for pregnant women and those
      with mental health conditions including evidence on health outcomes.

TI  - Lung Cancer Risk and Demographic Characteristics of Current 20-29 Pack-year
      Smokers: Implications for Screening.
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djv226 [doi]
LID - djv226 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Based on current recommendations, 30+ pack-years of smoking are
      required for eligibility for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening; former
      smokers must have quit within 15 years. We investigated whether current smokers
      with 20 to 29 pack-years have similar lung cancer risks as eligible former
      smokers and also whether they have a different demographic profile. METHODS: The 
      Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) was a
      randomly assigned screening trial of subjects age 55 to 74 years with chest
      radiographs (CXR) used for lung cancer. Subjects completed a baseline
      questionnaire containing smoking history questions. Cox proportional hazards
      models, adjusted for age and sex, were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HRs)
      for various smoking history groups. Next, we utilized the National Health
      Interview Survey (NHIS), which inquired about smoking history and race/ethnicity,
      to analyze the demographic profiles of various high-risk smoking history
      categories. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The PLCO cohort
      included 18 114 former and 12 243 current LDCT-eligible smokers, plus 2283 20- to
      29-pack-year current smokers. The hazard ratio for 20- to 29-pack-year current
      smokers compared with eligible (30+ pack-year) former smokers was 1.07 (95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.75 to 1.5). Based on the NHIS, 10 million persons in
      the United States are currently LDCT eligible; an additional 1.6 million (16%,
      95% CI = 13.6% to 19.0%) are 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers. The percentage 
      increase in eligibles if 20- to 29-pack-year current smokers were included was
      substantially greater for women than men (22.2%, 95% CI = 17.9% to 26.7%; vs
      12.2%, 95% CI = 9.3% to 15.3%, P < .001) and for minorities than non-Hispanic
      whites (30.0%, 95% CI = 24.2% to 36.0%; vs 14.1%, 95% CI = 11.1% to 17.0%, P <
      .001). CONCLUSION: The potential benefits and harms of recommending LDCT
      screening for 20 to 29-pack-year current smokers should be assessed.

TI  - Adolescent Pregnancy Guidelines.
PG  - 740-59
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the needs and evidence-based practice specific to care of 
      the pregnant adolescent in Canada, including special populations. OUTCOMES:
      Healthy pregnancies for adolescent women in Canada, with culturally sensitive and
      age-appropriate care to ensure the best possible outcomes for these young women
      and their infants and young families, and to reduce repeat pregnancy rates.
      EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed and The
      Cochrane Library on May 23, 2012 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g.,
      Pregnancy in Adolescence) and key words (e.g., pregnancy, teen, youth). Results
      were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized control trials/controlled
      clinical trials, and observational studies. Results were limited to English or
      French language materials published in or after 1990. Searches were updated on a 
      regular basis and incorporated in the guideline to July 6, 2013. Grey
      (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health 
      technology assessment and health technology-related agencies, national and
      international medical specialty societies, and clinical practice guideline
      collections. VALUES: The quality of evidence in this document was rated using the
      criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health 
      Care (Table 1). BENEFITS/HARMS/COSTS: These guidelines are designed to help
      practitioners caring for adolescent women during pregnancy in Canada and allow
      them to take the best care of these young women in a manner appropriate for their
      age, cultural backgrounds, and risk profiles. RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Health care
      providers should adapt their prenatal care for adolescents and offer
      multidisciplinary care that is easily accessible to the adolescent early in the
      pregnancy, recognizing that adolescents often present to care later than their
      adult counterparts. A model that provides an opportunity to address all of these 
      needs at one site may be the preferred model of care for pregnant adolescents.
      (II-1A) 2. Health care providers should be sensitive to the unique developmental 
      needs of adolescents through all stages of pregnancy and during intrapartum and
      postpartum care. (III-B) 3. Adolescents have high-risk pregnancies and should be 
      managed accordingly within programs that have the capacity to manage their care. 
      The unique physical risks of adolescent pregnancy should be recognized and the
      care provided must address these. (II-1A) 4. Fathers and partners should be
      included as much as possible in pregnancy care and prenatal/infant care
      education. (III-B) 5. A first-trimester ultrasound is recommended not only for
      the usual reasons for properly dating the pregnancy, but also for assessing the
      increased risks of preterm birth. (I-A) 6. Counselling about all available
      pregnancy outcome options (abortion, adoption, and parenting) should be provided 
      to any adolescent with a confirmed intrauterine gestation. (III-A) 7. Testing for
      sexually transmitted infections (STI) (II-2A) and bacterial vaginosis (III-B)
      should be performed routinely upon presentation for pregnancy care and again in
      the third trimester; STI testing should also be performed postpartum and when
      needed symptomatically. a. Because pregnant adolescents are inherently at
      increased risk for preterm labour, preterm birth, and preterm pre-labour rupture 
      of membranes, screening and management of bacterial vaginosis is recommended.
      (III-B) b. After treatment for a positive test, a test of cure is needed 3 to 4
      weeks after completion of treatment. Refer partner for screening and treatment.
      Take the opportunity to discuss condom use. (III-A) 8. Routine and repeated
      screening for alcohol use, substance abuse, and violence in pregnancy is
      recommended because of their increased rates in this population. (II-2A) 9.
      Routine and repeated screening for and treatment of mood disorders in pregnancy
      is recommended because of their increased rates in this population. The Edinburgh
      Postnatal Depression Scale administered in each trimester and postpartum, and
      more frequently if deemed necessary, is one option for such screening. (II-2A)
      10. Pregnant adolescents should have a nutritional assessment, vitamins and food 
      supplementation if needed, and access to a strategy to reduce anemia and low
      birth weight and to optimize weight gain in pregnancy. (II-2A) 11. Conflicting
      evidence supports and refutes differences in gestational hypertension in the
      adolescent population; therefore, the care usual for adult populations is
      supported for pregnant adolescents at this time. (II-2A) 12. Practitioners should
      consult gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) guidelines. In theory, testing all
      patients is appropriate, although rates of GDM are generally lower in adolescent 
      populations. Practitioners should be aware, however, that certain ethnic groups
      including Aboriginal populations are at high risk of GDM. (II-2A) 13. An
      ultrasound anatomical assessment at 16 to 20 weeks is recommended because of
      increased rates of congenital anomalies in this population. (II-2A) 14. As in
      other populations at risk of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth
      weight, an ultrasound to assess fetal well-being and estimated fetal weight at 32
      to 34 weeks gestational age is suggested to screen for IUGR. (III-A) 15. Visits
      in the second or third trimester should be more frequent to address the increased
      risk of preterm labour and preterm birth and to assess fetal well-being. All
      caregivers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of preterm labour and should
      educate their patients to recognize them. (III-A) 16. It should be recognized
      that adolescents have improved vaginal delivery rates and a concomitantly lower
      Caesarean section rate than their adult counterparts. (II-2A) As with antenatal
      care, peripartum care in hospital should be multidisciplinary, involving social
      care, support for breastfeeding and lactation, and the involvement of children's 
      aid services when warranted. (III-B) 17. Postpartum care should include a focus
      on contraceptive methods, especially long-acting reversible contraception
      methods, as a means to decrease the high rates of repeat pregnancy in this
      population; discussion of contraception should begin before delivery. (III-A) 18.
      Breastfeeding should be recommended and sufficient support given to this
      population at high risk for discontinuation. (II-2A) 19. Postpartum care programs
      should be available to support adolescent parents and their children, to improve 
      the mothers' knowledge of parenting, to increase breastfeeding rates, to screen
      for and manage postpartum depression, to increase birth intervals, and to
      decrease repeated unintended pregnancy rates. (III-B) 20. Adolescent women in
      rural, remote, northern, and Aboriginal communities should be supported to give
      birth as close to home as possible. (II-2A) 21. Adolescent pregnant women who
      need to be evacuated from a remote community should be able to have a family
      member or other person accompany them to provide support and encouragement.
      (II-2A) 22. Culturally safe prenatal care including emotional, educational, and
      clinical support to assist adolescent parents in leading healthier lives should
      be available, especially in northern and Aboriginal communities. (II-3A) 23.
      Cultural beliefs around miscarriage and pregnancy issues, and special
      considerations in the handling of fetal remains, placental tissue, and the
      umbilical cord, must be respected. (III).

AB  - OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of two speech therapy interventions, vocal
      warm-up and breathing training, focusing on teachers' voice quality.METHODS A
      single-blind, randomized, parallel clinical trial was conducted. The research
      included 31 20 to 60-year old teachers from a public school in Salvador, BA,
      Northeasatern Brazil, with minimum workloads of 20 hours a week, who have or have
      not reported having vocal alterations. The exclusion criteria were the following:
      being a smoker, excessive alcohol consumption, receiving additional speech
      therapy assistance while taking part in the study, being affected by upper
      respiratory tract infections, professional use of the voice in another activity, 
      neurological disorders, and history of cardiopulmonary pathologies. The subjects 
      were distributed through simple randomization in groups vocal warm-up (n = 14)
      and breathing training (n = 17). The teachers' voice quality was subjectively
      evaluated through the Voice Handicap Index (Indice de Desvantagem Vocal, in the
      Brazilian version) and computerized voice analysis (average fundamental
      frequency, jitter, shimmer, noise, and glottal-to-noise excitation ratio) by
      speech therapists.RESULTS Before the interventions, the groups were similar
      regarding sociodemographic characteristics, teaching activities, and vocal
      quality. The variations before and after the intervention in self-assessment and 
      acoustic voice indicators have not significantly differed between the groups. In 
      the comparison between groups before and after the six-week interventions,
      significant reductions in the Voice Handicap Index of subjects in both groups
      were observed, as wells as reduced average fundamental frequencies in the vocal
      warm-up group and increased shimmer in the breathing training group. Subjects
      from the vocal warm-up group reported speaking more easily and having their
      voices more improved in a general way as compared to the breathing training
      group.CONCLUSIONS Both interventions were similar regarding their effects on the 
      teachers' voice quality. However, each contribution has individually contributed 
      to improve the teachers' voice quality, especially the vocal warm-up.TRIAL RECORD

      organizational Web sites were searched through 1 August 2014 for systematic
      reviews, and PubMed was searched through 1 March 2015 for trials on electronic
      nicotine delivery systems. STUDY SELECTION: Two reviewers examined 114 articles
      to identify English-language reviews that reported health, cessation, or adverse 
      outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer abstracted data from good- and
      fair-quality reviews, and a second checked for accuracy. DATA SYNTHESIS: 54
      reviews were included. Behavioral interventions increased smoking cessation at 6 
      months or more (physician advice had a pooled risk ratio [RR] of 1.76 [95% CI,
      1.58 to 1.96]). Nicotine replacement therapy (RR, 1.60 [CI, 1.53 to 1.68]),
      bupropion (RR, 1.62 [CI, 1.49 to 1.76]), and varenicline (RR, 2.27 [CI, 2.02 to
      2.55]) were also effective for smoking cessation. Combined behavioral and
      pharmacotherapy interventions increased cessation by 82% compared with minimal
      intervention or usual care (RR, 1.82 [CI, 1.66 to 2.00]). None of the drugs were 
      associated with major cardiovascular adverse events. Only 2 trials addressed
      efficacy of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation and found no benefit.
      Among pregnant women, behavioral interventions benefited cessation and perinatal 
      health; effects of nicotine replacement therapy were not significant. LIMITATION:
      Evidence published after each review's last search date was not included.
      CONCLUSION: Behavioral and pharmacotherapy interventions improve rates of smoking
      cessation among the general adult population, alone or in combination. Data on
      the effectiveness and safety of electronic nicotine delivery systems are limited.

TI  - The Tobacco Status Project (TSP): Study protocol for a randomized controlled
      trial of a Facebook smoking cessation intervention for young adults.
PG  - 897
LID - 10.1186/s12889-015-2217-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use remains the leading cause of premature morbidity and
      mortality in the United States. Young adults are less successful at quitting, use
      cessation treatment less often than smokers of other ages, and can be a challenge
      to retain in treatment. Social media, integrated into the lives of many young
      adults, represents a promising strategy to deliver evidence-based smoking
      cessation treatment to a large, diverse audience. The goal of this trial is to
      test the efficacy of a stage-based smoking cessation intervention on Facebook for
      young adults age 18 to 25 on smoking abstinence, reduction in cigarettes smoked, 
      and thoughts about smoking abstinence. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a randomized
      controlled trial. Young adult smokers throughout the United States are recruited 
      online and randomized to either the 3 month Tobacco Status Project intervention
      on Facebook or a referral to a smoking cessation website. The intervention
      consists of assignment to a secret Facebook group tailored to readiness to quit
      smoking (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation), daily Facebook contacts
      tailored to readiness to quit smoking, weekly live counseling sessions, and for
      those in preparation, weekly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy counseling sessions on 
      Facebook. Primary outcome measure is biochemically-verified 7-day point
      prevalence abstinence from smoking at posttreatment (3 months), 6, and 12 months.
      Secondary outcome measures are reduction of 50 % or more in cigarettes smoked, 24
      h quit attempts, and commitment to abstinence at each time point. A secondary aim
      is to test, within the TSP condition, the effect of a monetary incentive at
      increasing engagement in the intervention. DISCUSSION: This randomized controlled
      trial is testing a novel Facebook intervention for treating young adults' tobacco
      use. If efficacious, the social media intervention could be disseminated widely
      and expanded to address additional health risks. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Polysomnographic sleep disturbances in nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, cocaine,
      opioid, and cannabis use: A focused review.
PG  - 590-8
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12291 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the United States, approximately 60 million
      Americans suffer from sleep disorders and about 22 million Americans report
      substance dependence or use disorders annually. Sleep disturbances are common
      consequences of substance use disorders and are likely found in primary care as
      well as in specialty practices. The aim of this review was to evaluate the
      effects of the most frequently used substances-nicotine, alcohol, opioids,
      cocaine, caffeine, and cannabis-have on sleep parameters measured by
      polysomnography (PSG) and related clinical manifestations. METHODS: We used
      electronic databases such as PubMED and PsycINFO to search for relevant articles.
      We only included studies that assessed sleep disturbances using polysomnography
      and reviewed the effects of these substances on six clinically relevant sleep
      parameters: Total sleep time, sleep onset latency, rapid-eye movement, REM
      latency, wake after sleep onset, and slow wave sleep. RESULTS: Our review
      indicates that these substances have significant impact on sleep and that their
      effects differ during intoxication, withdrawal, and chronic use. Many of the
      substance-induced sleep disturbances overlap with those encountered in sleep
      disorders, medical, and psychiatric conditions. Sleep difficulties also increase 
      the likelihood of substance use disorder relapse, further emphasizing the need
      for optimizing treatment interventions in these patients. CONCLUSION AND
      SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Our review highlights the importance of systematically
      screening for substance use in patients with sleep disturbances and highlights
      the need for further research to understand mechanisms underlying
      substances-induced sleep disturbances and on effective interventions addressing
      these conditions.

TI  - The Effect of a Patient-Provider Educational Intervention to Reduce At-Risk
      Drinking on Changes in Health and Health-Related Quality of Life Among Older
      Adults: The Project SHARE Study.
PG  - 14-20
LID - 10.1016/j.jsat.2015.06.019 [doi]
LID - S0740-5472(15)00167-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: At-risk drinking, defined as alcohol use that is excessive or
      potentially harmful in combination with select comorbidities or medications,
      affects about 10% of older adults in the United States and is associated with
      higher mortality. The Project SHARE intervention, which uses patient and provider
      educational materials, physician counseling, and health educator support, was
      designed to reduce at-risk drinking among this vulnerable population. Although an
      earlier study showed that this intervention was successful in reducing rates of
      at-risk drinking, it is unknown whether these reductions translate into improved 
      health and health-related quality of life (HRQL). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this
      study was to examine changes in health and HRQL of older adult at-risk drinkers
      resulting from a patient-provider educational intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN: A
      randomized controlled trial to compare the health and HRQL outcomes of patients
      assigned to the Project SHARE intervention vs. care as usual at baseline, 6- and 
      12-months post assignment. Control patients received usual care, which may or may
      not have included alcohol counseling. Intervention group patients received a
      personalized patient report, educational materials on alcohol and aging, a brief 
      provider intervention, and a telephone health educator intervention. SUBJECTS:
      Current drinkers 60years and older accessing primary care clinics around Santa
      Barbara, California (N=1049). MEASUREMENTS: Data were collected from patients
      using baseline, 6- and 12-month mail surveys. Health and HRQL measures included
      mental and physical component scores (MCS and PCS) based on the Short Form-12v2
      (SF-12v2), the SF-6D, which is also based on the SF-12, and the Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS). Adjusted associations of treatment assignment with these 
      outcomes were estimated using generalized least squares regressions with random
      provider effects. Regressions controlled for age group, sex, race/ethnicity,
      marital status, education, household income, home ownership and the baseline
      value of the dependent variable. RESULTS: After regression adjustment, the
      intervention was associated with a 0.58 point (95% CI: -0.06, 1.21) increase in
      6-month MCS and a 0.14 point (95% CI: 0.01, 0.26) improvement in 12-month GDS
      score, compared to the control group. The intervention also increased adjusted
      SF-6D scores by 0.01 points at both 6 and 12months (6-month 95% CI: 0.01, 0.02;
      12-month 95% CI: 0.01, 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the previously shown
      effectiveness of the Project SHARE intervention to reduce at-risk drinking among 
      older adults, this effect translated into effects on health and HRQL that were
      statistically but not necessarily clinically significant. Effects were most
      prominent for patients who received physician discussions, suggesting that
      provider counseling may be a critical component of primary care-based
      interventions targeting at-risk alcohol use.

TI  - Cultural adaptation of a brief motivational intervention for heavy drinking among
      Hispanics in a medical setting.
PG  - 724
LID - 10.1186/s12889-015-1984-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hispanics, particularly men of Mexican origin, are more likely to
      engage in heavy drinking and experience alcohol-related problems, but less likely
      to obtain treatment for alcohol problems than non-Hispanic men. Our previous
      research indicates that heavy-drinking Hispanics who received a brief
      motivational intervention (BMI) were significantly more likely than Hispanics
      receiving standard care to reduce subsequent alcohol use. Among Hispanics who
      drink heavily the BMI effectively reduced alcohol use but did not impact
      alcohol-related problems or treatment utilization. We hypothesized that an
      adapted BMI that integrates cultural values and addresses acculturative stress
      among Hispanics would be more effective. METHODS/DESIGN: We describe here the
      protocol for the design and implementation of a randomized (approximately 300
      patients per condition) controlled trial evaluating the comparative effectiveness
      of a culturally adapted (CA) BMI in contrast to a non-adapted BMI (NA-BMI) in a
      community hospital setting among men of Mexican origin. Study participants will
      include men who were hospitalized due to an alcohol related injury or screened
      positive for heavy drinking. By accounting for risk and protective factors of
      heavy drinking among Hispanics, we hypothesize that CA-BMI will significantly
      decrease alcohol use and alcohol problems, and increase help-seeking and
      treatment utilization. DISCUSSION: This is likely the first study to directly
      address alcohol related health disparities among non-treatment seeking men of
      Mexican origin by comparing the benefits of a CA-BMI to a NA-BMI. This study
      stands to not only inform interventions used in medical settings to reduce
      alcohol-related health disparities, but may also help reduce the public health
      burden of heavy alcohol use in the United States. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Trial

TI  - Prevalence of cirrhosis in hepatitis C patients in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort
      Study (CHeCS): a retrospective and prospective observational study.
PG  - 1169-77; quiz 1178
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2015.203 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The severity of liver disease in the hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected
      population in the United States remains uncertain. We estimated the prevalence of
      cirrhosis in adults with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) using multiple parameters
      including liver biopsy, diagnosis/procedure codes, and a biomarker. METHODS:
      Patients enrolled in the Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study (CHeCS) who received
      health services during 2006-2010 were included. Cirrhosis was identified through 
      liver biopsy reports, diagnosis/procedure codes for cirrhosis or hepatic
      decompensation, and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) scores >/=5.88. Demographic and clinical
      characteristics associated with cirrhosis were identified through multivariable
      logistic modeling. RESULTS: Among 9,783 patients, 2,788 (28.5%) were cirrhotic by
      at least one method. Biopsy identified cirrhosis in only 661 (7%) patients,
      whereas FIB-4 scores and diagnosis/procedure codes for cirrhosis and hepatic
      decompensation identified cirrhosis in 2,194 (22%), 557 (6%), and 482 (5%)
      patients, respectively. Among 661 patients with biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis, only 
      356 (54%) had an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
      Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) code for cirrhosis. Older age, male gender,
      Asian race, Hispanic ethnicity, genotype 3 infection, HIV coinfection, diabetes, 
      history of antiviral therapy, and history of alcohol abuse were independently
      associated with higher odds of cirrhosis (all, P<0.05). Conversely, private
      health insurance coverage, black race, and HCV genotype 2 were associated with
      lower odds of cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of patients with
      biopsy-confirmed cirrhosis are not assigned ICD-9 codes for cirrhosis.
      Consequently, ICD-9 codes may not be reliable as the sole indicator of the
      prevalence of cirrhosis in cohort studies. Use of additional parameters suggests 
      a fourfold higher prevalence of cirrhosis than is revealed by biopsy alone. These
      findings suggest that cirrhosis in CHC patients may be significantly
      underdocumented and underdiagnosed.

BTI - Treatment for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Operational Stress Injury, or
      Critical Incident Stress: A Review of Guidelines
AB  - Critical incidents are events where individuals witness or experience tragedy,
      death, serious injuries, or threatening situations, which may have strong
      emotional impact. Emergency service workers and law enforcement workers are often
      affected by critical incident stress (CIS), which may or may not develop a
      post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) after a critical incident or traumatic
      event. The signs and symptoms of CIS can be physical (e.g., fatigue, headache,
      dizziness), cognitive (e.g., confusion, nightmares, poor attention and
      concentration), emotional (e.g., fear, guilt, anger, depression, chronic anxiety)
      and behavioral (e.g., restlessness, withdrawal, increased alcohol consumption).
      Tools for the management of CIS include demobilization, crisis management
      briefings, defusing, and debriefing. Operational stress injury (OSI) is a
      non-medical term describing a broad range of medical conditions including
      anxiety, depression, PTSD, and other less severe conditions. OSI is usually
      associated with warfare, where intense combat can cause severe psychiatric
      symptoms, leading to substance abuse, depression, anxiety, and amnesia. PTSD is
      one of the most common OSIs. PTSD is characterized by intrusive or distressing
      thoughts, nightmares, and flashbacks of past exposure to traumatic events,
      including sudden death of loved ones, accidents, natural disasters, sexual
      assault, combat injury, and torture. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD in Canada
      was estimated to be 9.2%, with one month prevalence rates of 2.4%. Women in
      general are more likely to develop PTSD than men after exposure to traumatic
      events. PTSD has been associated with high rates of chronic pain, sleep problems,
      and sexual and cognitive dysfunction, leading to a significant decrease in
      quality of life. PTSD has been associated with an increased cost of health care
      due to more often and longer hospitalizations. There is a paucity of convincing
      evidence that both the psychological and pharmacological strategies can be
      successfully used in the prevention or early intervention of PTSD. On the other
      hand, patients with established PTSD can be managed using later pharmacological
      and/or psychological interventions. There are numerous types of drugs and
      psychotherapy approaches that may or may not have good clinical evidence for
      efficacy in treating PTSD. The aim of this report is to review the guidelines
      regarding treatment for PTSD, OSI, or CIS.

TI  - Outcomes of a Tailored Intervention for Cigarette Smoking Cessation Among Latinos
      Living With HIV/AIDS.
PG  - 975-82
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntv014 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tobacco use has emerged as a leading killer among persons living
      with HIV, with effective approaches to tobacco treatment still unknown. HIV
      infection is nearly 3 times as prevalent in Latinos than in non-Latino Whites.
      This study reports the results of a randomized trial comparing a tailored
      intervention to brief counseling for smoking cessation among Latino smokers
      living with HIV (LSLWH). METHODS: LSLWH (N = 302; 36% female, 10% employed
      full-time, 49% born in United States) were randomized to 4 in-person sessions of 
      a tailored intervention (Aurora) or 2 in-person sessions of brief advice
      (enhanced standard care [ESC]). Both groups received 8 weeks of nicotine
      replacement therapy (NRT) patch. Biochemically validated 6- and 12-month 7-day
      point-prevalence abstinence (PPA) rates were compared, along with secondary
      outcomes (e.g., reduction to light smoking, NRT adherence). RESULTS: Seven-day
      PPA rates reached 8% versus 11% at 6 months and 6% versus 7% at 12 months, for
      Aurora and ESC, respectively, with no between-group differences (p values > .40).
      Significant changes from baseline to 6 and 12 months among intervention targets
      were noted (percentage reduction in heavy smoking and dependence; increases in
      knowledge and self-efficacy). Baseline smoking frequency, older age, and higher
      intensity of patch use during the trial emerged as significant predictors of
      abstinence at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence that the tailored
      intervention improved cessation rates. Interventions that encourage use of, and
      adherence to, empirically validated cessation aids require further development to
      reduce tobacco-related death and disease in this vulnerable population.

TI  - Effectiveness of Housing First with Intensive Case Management in an Ethnically
      Diverse Sample of Homeless Adults with Mental Illness: A Randomized Controlled
      Trial.
PG  - e0130281
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0130281 [doi]
AB  - Housing First (HF) is being widely disseminated in efforts to end homelessness
      among homeless adults with psychiatric disabilities. This study evaluates the
      effectiveness of HF with Intensive Case Management (ICM) among ethnically diverse
      homeless adults in an urban setting. 378 participants were randomized to HF with 
      ICM or treatment-as-usual (TAU) in Toronto (Canada), and followed for 24 months. 
      Measures of effectiveness included housing stability, physical (EQ5D-VAS) and
      mental (CSI, GAIN-SS) health, social functioning (MCAS), quality of life
      (QoLI20), and health service use. Two-thirds of the sample (63%) was from
      racialized groups and half (50%) were born outside Canada. Over the 24 months of 
      follow-up, HF participants spent a significantly greater percentage of time in
      stable residences compared to TAU participants (75.1% 95% CI 70.5 to 79.7 vs.
      39.3% 95% CI 34.3 to 44.2, respectively). Similarly, community functioning (MCAS)
      improved significantly from baseline in HF compared to TAU participants (change
      in mean difference = +1.67 95% CI 0.04 to 3.30). There was a significant
      reduction in the number of days spent experiencing alcohol problems among the HF 
      compared to TAU participants at 24 months (ratio of rate ratios = 0.47 95% CI
      0.22 to 0.99) relative to baseline, a reduction of 53%. Although the number of
      emergency department visits and days in hospital over 24 months did not differ
      significantly between HF and TAU participants, fewer HF participants compared to 
      TAU participants had 1 or more hospitalizations during this period (70.4% vs.
      81.1%, respectively; P=0.044). Compared to non-racialized HF participants,
      racialized HF participants saw an increase in the amount of money spent on
      alcohol (change in mean difference = $112.90 95% CI 5.84 to 219.96) and a
      reduction in physical community integration (ratio of rate ratios = 0.67 95% CI
      0.47 to 0.96) from baseline to 24 months. Secondary analyses found a significant 
      reduction in the number of days experiencing problems due to alcohol use among
      foreign-born (vs. Canadian-born) HF participants at 24 months (ratio of rate
      ratios = 0.19 95% 0.04 to 0.88), relative to baseline. Compared to usual care, HF
      with ICM can improve housing stability and community functioning and reduce the
      days of alcohol related problems in an ethnically diverse sample of homeless
      adults with mental illness within 2-years. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

AB  - PURPOSE: Women's poor postpartum psychosocial and behavioral health may
      negatively affect them and their infants. Validated postpartum screening scales
      can help to identify problems early, but currently there is limited knowledge in 
      this area. Thus, we conducted a systematic examination of self-administered
      psychosocial and behavioral scales validated for postpartum women in the United
      States in the domains of depression, body image, diet, physical activity,
      smoking, and alcohol use. We examined the characteristics of included scales,
      their validation samples, and reported psychometric properties. METHOD: Nine
      databases were searched during October 2014 through February 2015. After meeting 
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, article information was extracted independently by 
      two authors, compared, and differences were resolved through discussions.
      RESULTS: The final sample included 23 published articles covering 19 scales.
      Seventeen were in the domain of depression, and one each in physical activity and
      dietary domains. None was found in the domains of body image, smoking, or alcohol
      use. The number of scale items varied from 2 to 35. The majority of scales were
      originally designed for postpartum women, and validated in one or two postpartum 
      studies with samples of predominantly adult women. If reported, scale reliability
      coefficients were generally 0.80 or greater and validity coefficients of 0.70 or 
      greater. Five depression scales had favorable sensitivity and specificity using
      standard cutpoints, but only one was tested across adolescent, low-income, and
      predominantly ethnic minority postpartum populations. CONCLUSION: No
      U.S.-validated postpartum scales were found for body image, smoking, or alcohol
      use. Most scales had limited validity testing, and validation was in
      predominantly advantaged samples. Further scale development and testing are
      recommended.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of
      tuberculosis (TB) patients and contacts is important. Despite existing
      guidelines, not all patients are tested, and testing of contacts is rarely
      performed. METHODS: In a study conducted at nine US/Canadian sites, we introduced
      formal procedures for offering HIV testing to TB patients and contacts. Data were
      collected via interviews and medical record review. Characteristics associated
      with offering and accepting HIV testing were examined. RESULTS: Of 651 TB
      patients, 601 (92%) were offered testing, 511 (85%) accepted, and 51 (10%) were
      HIV-infected. Of 4152 contacts, 3099 (75%) were offered testing, 1202 (39%)
      accepted, and 24 (2%) were HIV-infected. Contacts aged 15-64 years, non-Whites,
      foreign-born persons, smokers, those with positive TB screening, and household
      contacts were more likely to be offered testing, whereas contacts exposed to
      HIV-negative patients were less likely to be offered testing. Contacts aged 15-64
      years, smokers, drug/alcohol users, diabetics, and those with positive TB
      screening were more likely to accept testing. Foreign-born persons, Blacks,
      Hispanics, and contacts exposed to HIV-positive patients were less likely to
      accept testing. CONCLUSIONS: High rates of HIV were detected among patients and
      contacts. Despite structured procedures to offer HIV testing, some patients and
      most contacts did not accept testing. Strategies are needed to improve testing
      acceptance rates.

TI  - Attitudes and Beliefs of Primary Care Providers in New Mexico About Lung Cancer
      Screening Using Low-Dose Computed Tomography.
PG  - E108
LID - 10.5888/pcd12.150112 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: On the basis of results from the National Lung Screening Trial
      (NLST), national guidelines now recommend using low-dose computed tomography
      (LDCT) to screen high-risk smokers for lung cancer. Our study objective was to
      characterize the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of primary care providers
      about implementing LDCT screening. METHODS: We conducted semistructured
      interviews with primary care providers practicing in New Mexico clinics for
      underserved minority populations. The interviews, conducted from February through
      September 2014, focused on providers' tobacco cessation efforts, lung cancer
      screening practices, perceptions of NLST and screening guidelines, and attitudes 
      about informed decision making for cancer screening. Investigators iteratively
      reviewed transcripts to create a coding structure. RESULTS: We reached thematic
      saturation after interviewing 10 providers practicing in 6 urban and 4 rural
      settings; 8 practiced at federally qualified health centers. All 10 providers
      promoted smoking cessation, some screened with chest x-rays, and none screened
      with LDCT. Not all were aware of NLST results or current guideline
      recommendations. Providers viewed study results skeptically, particularly the 95%
      false-positive rate, the need to screen 320 patients to prevent 1 lung cancer
      death, and the small proportion of minority participants. Providers were
      uncertain whether New Mexico had the necessary infrastructure to support
      high-quality screening, and worried about access barriers and financial burdens
      for rural, underinsured populations. Providers noted the complexity of discussing
      benefits and harms of screening and surveillance with their patient population.
      CONCLUSION: Providers have several concerns about the feasibility and
      appropriateness of implementing LDCT screening. Effective lung cancer screening
      programs will need to educate providers and patients to support informed decision
      making and to ensure that high-quality screening can be efficiently delivered in 
      community practice.

TI  - Characteristics of Internal Medicine Physicians Disciplined by Professional
      Colleges in Canada.
PG  - e937
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000000937 [doi]
AB  - Physician misconduct is of serious concern to patient safety and quality of care.
      Currently, there are limited data on disciplinary proceedings involving internal 
      medicine (IM) physicians.The aim of this study was to investigate the number and 
      nature of disciplinary cases among IM physicians compared with those of other
      disciplined physicians.Our retrospective study reviewed information from all
      provincial Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS) and compiled a database of
      all disciplined physicians from 2000 to 2013 in Canada. Disciplinary rate
      differences (RDs) were calculated for IM physicians and compared with other
      physicians.From 2000 to 2013, overall disciplinary rates were low (9.6 cases per 
      10,000 physician years). There were 899 disciplinary cases, 49 of which involved 
      45 different IM physicians. IM physicians comprised 10.8% of all disciplined
      physicians and were disciplined at a lower rate than non-IM physicians, incurring
      5.18 fewer cases per 10,000 physician years than other physicians (95% confidence
      interval [CI] 3.62-6.73; P < 0.001). They were significantly less likely to be
      disciplined for: unprofessional conduct (RD 1.16; CI 0.45-1.87; P = 0.001);
      unlicensed activity (RD 0.78; CI 0.37-1.19; P < 0.001); standard of care issues
      (RD 1.37; CI 0.49-2.26; P = 0.002); sexual misconduct (RD 1.65; CI 0.90-2.40; P <
      0.001); miscellaneous (RD 0.80; CI 0.11-1.50; P = 0.020); mental illness (RD
      0.06; CI 0.01-0.12; P = 0.025); inappropriate prescribing (RD 0.74; CI 0.15-1.33;
      P = 0.010); and criminal conviction (RD 0.33; CI 0.00-0.65; P = 0.048). No
      significant differences were found with respect to unclear violations, fraudulent
      behavior/prevarication, or offenses involving drugs/alcohol (all RDs less than
      0.32). IM physicians were also less likely to incur the following penalties:
      voluntary license surrender (RD 0.53; CI 0.37-0.69; P < 0.001); suspension (RD
      2.39; CI 1.26-3.51; P < 0.001); retraining/assessment (RD 1.58; CI 0.77-2.39; P <
      0.001); restriction (RD 1.60; CI 0.74-2.46; P < 0.001); other (RD 0.52; CI
      0.07-0.97; P = 0.030); formal reprimand (RD 2.78; CI 1.77-3.79; P < 0.001); or
      fine (RD 3.28; CI 1.89-4.67; P < 0.001). No significant differences were found
      with respect to revocation or mandated counseling/rehabilitation (all RDs less
      than 0.46).Generally, disciplinary rates among physicians were low. Compared with
      other physicians, IM physicians have significantly lower disciplinary rates
      overall and are less likely to incur the majority of disciplinary offenses and
      penalties.

TI  - Restrictions for Medicaid Reimbursement of Sofosbuvir for the Treatment of
      Hepatitis C Virus Infection in the United States.
PG  - 215-23
LID - 10.7326/M15-0406 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate state Medicaid policies for 
      the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with sofosbuvir in the United 
      States. Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir were evaluated in all 50
      states and the District of Columbia. The authors searched state Medicaid Web
      sites between 23 June and 7 December 2014 and extracted data in duplicate. Any
      differences were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on whether sofosbuvir
      was covered and the criteria for coverage based on the following categories:
      liver disease stage, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use. 
      Of the 42 states with known Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir, 74%
      limit sofosbuvir access to persons with advanced fibrosis (Meta-Analysis of
      Histologic Data in Viral Hepatitis [METAVIR] fibrosis stage F3) or cirrhosis
      (F4). One quarter of states require persons co-infected with HCV and HIV to be
      receiving antiretroviral therapy or to have suppressed HIV RNA levels. Two thirds
      of states have restrictions based on prescriber type, and 88% include drug or
      alcohol use in their sofosbuvir eligibility criteria, with 50% requiring a period
      of abstinence and 64% requiring urine drug screening. Heterogeneity is present in
      Medicaid reimbursement criteria for sofosbuvir with respect to liver disease
      staging, HIV co-infection, prescriber type, and drug or alcohol use across the
      United States. Restrictions do not seem to conform with recommendations from
      professional organizations, such as the Infectious Diseases Society of America
      and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. Current
      restrictions seem to violate federal Medicaid law, which requires states to cover
      drugs consistent with their U.S. Food and Drug Administration labels.

LID - S0124-00642014000500012 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for smoking
      cessation in the context of clinical practice guidelines (CPG). METHODS: A
      systematic review of CPGs was conducted, aimed at adapting recommendations for
      Colombia following the ADAPTE methodology. Outcomes comprised 6-months or higher 
      smoking cessation rates and intervention safety. CPGs were peer-assessed based on
      DELBI. Results from aggregative studies included in selected CPGs were obtained. 
      RESULTS: Pharmacotherapy doubles smoking cessation rates as compared with
      placebos (rates @25% and up to 27 % when combined with counseling). The highest
      efficacy was observed for ansyolitic and antidepressive drugs (8.7 % to 19.4 %), 
      and the lowest for nicotine replacement therapy -NRT- (5.2 % to 12.9 %).
      Nortriptiline shows an efficacy similar to that of bupropion (@10%). With limited
      exceptions, combined pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation has shown no
      significant increase in cessation rates. CONCLUSIONS: NRT, varenicline, bupropion
      and nortriptiline are effective treatments for smoking cessation. Combination of 
      drugs deserves further clinical evidence and should be restricted to highly
      dependent smokers or initial therapeutic failure. Cost-effectiveness analyses
      might help to introduce smoking cessation programs in low and middle income
      countries.

TI  - Association between physical pain and alcohol treatment outcomes: The mediating
      role of negative affect.
PG  - 1044-57
LID - 10.1037/ccp0000033 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physical pain and negative affect have been described as risk factors 
      for alcohol use following alcohol treatment. The current study was a secondary
      analysis of 2 clinical trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD) to examine the
      associations between pain, negative affect and AUD treatment outcomes. METHOD:
      Participants included 1,383 individuals from the COMBINE Study (COMBINE
      Pharmacotherapies and Behavioral Interventions for Alcohol Dependence; COMBINE
      Study Research Group, 2003; 31% female, 23% ethnic minorities, average age = 44.4
      [SD = 10.2]), a multisite combination pharmacotherapy and behavioral intervention
      study for AUD in the United States, and 742 individuals from the United Kingdom
      Alcohol Treatment Trial (UKATT Research Team, 2001; 25.9% female, 4.4% ethnic
      minorities, average age = 41.6 [SD = 10.1]) a multisite behavioral intervention
      study for AUD in the United Kingdom. The Form-90 was used to collect alcohol use 
      data, the Short Form Health Survey and Quality of Life measures were used to
      assess pain, and negative affect was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory
      (COMBINE) and the General Health Questionnaire (UKATT). RESULTS: Pain scores were
      significantly associated with drinking outcomes in both datasets. Greater pain
      scores were associated with greater negative affect and increases in pain were
      associated with increases in negative affect. Negative affect significantly
      mediated the association between pain and drinking outcomes and this effect was
      moderated by social behavior network therapy (SBNT) in the UKATT study, with SBNT
      attenuating the association between pain and drinking. CONCLUSION: Findings
      suggest pain and negative affect are associated among individuals in AUD
      treatment and that negative affect mediated pain may be a risk factor for alcohol
      relapse.

TI  - [Determining an appropriate scheme for "Quitline" in Japan].
PG  - 125-32
LID - 10.11236/jph.62.3_125 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: "Quitline" is a telephone helpline that advises smokers who are
      contemplating quitting. Many countries, including East Asian countries, have been
      conducting nationwide quitline services; however, this has not been conducted in 
      Japan. The aim of this study was to characterize quitline services abroad and
      review their efficacy in helping smokers quit, in order to determine an
      appropriate scheme for Japan. METHODS: We investigated the present condition of
      quitline in Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
      Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom, focusing on its modalities. 
      Subsequently, we searched "Medline"and "Cochrane Database of Systematic
      Review"using free text terms of "hotlines"and "smoking cessation"to review the
      efficacy of the modalities used by the quitline services. Relevant articles from 
      the reference lists were also identified. RESULTS: In Asia Pacific countries,
      various tools were used by the quitline services, including a quit booklet,
      website, mobile phone service, and e-mail. Some of these countries conducted
      proactive counseling by a quitline counselor. There have been several
      meta-analyses and randomized-control trials showing the efficacy of individually 
      tailored materials in quitline services. To introduce an effective quitline
      service in Japan, it is desirable to provide individually tailored materials. In 
      addition, as Japanese smokers can easily access smoking cessation advice in
      hospitals, health check-up settings, and pharmacies, quitline services should be 
      connected with this infrastructure. CONCLUSION: To introduce an effective
      nationwide quitline service in Japan, it is necessary to provide various
      individually tailored materials that complement the smoking cessation
      infrastructure.

TI  - Development of a simple binary response questionnaire to identify airflow
      obstruction in a smoking population in Argentina.
PG  - 320-6
LID - 10.1183/16000617.00005214 [doi]
AB  - The CODE questionnaire (COPD detection questionnaire), a simple, binary response 
      scale (yes/no), screening questionnaire, was developed for the identification of 
      patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We conducted a survey
      of 468 subjects with a smoking history in 10 public hospitals in Argentina.
      Patients with a previous diagnosis of COPD, asthma and other respiratory illness 
      were excluded. Items that measured conceptual domains in terms of characteristics
      of symptoms, smoking history and demographics data were considered. 96 (20.5%)
      subjects had a diagnosis of COPD according to the 2010 Global Initiative for
      Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy document. The variables selected for
      the final questionnaire were based on univariate and multivariate analyses and
      clinical criteria. Finally, we selected the presence or absence of six variables 
      (age >/=50 years, smoking history >/=30 pack-years, male sex, chronic cough,
      chronic phlegm and dyspnoea). Of patients without any of these six variables (0
      points), none had COPD. The ability of the CODE questionnaire to discriminate
      between subjects with and without COPD was good (the area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve was 0.75). Higher scores were associated with a
      greater probability of COPD. The CODE questionnaire is a brief, accurate
      questionnaire that can identify smoking individuals likely to have COPD.

PG  - 280-5
LID - 10.1097/YCO.0000000000000173 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To summarize the recent literature (1st January 2014-1st
      February 2015) on stimulant treatment programme evaluations, and highlight key
      areas for future programme development. RECENT FINDINGS: Advances have been made 
      in addressing both sexual risks and stimulant use among gay and bisexual men in
      the United States, and in adapting evidence-based resource-intense interventions 
      to real-world settings. Programme outcome measures increasingly include changes
      in substance use as well as health and wellbeing indicators and measures of risk.
      SUMMARY: Future programme directions include: expansion of the psychosocial
      repertoire to include narrative and mindfulness-based therapies; web-based
      programme delivery; sex-sensitive programming to attract and retain women;
      comprehensive programming to address coexisting mental and physical illness and
      polysubstance use (including tobacco smoking); and improving accessibility to
      promote early intervention. Comparability of evaluation data can be improved by
      developing standardized tools particularly for measuring change in sexual-risk
      behavior. The use of new statistical techniques can address the lack of
      comparison populations.

TI  - Underuse and Overuse of Osteoporosis Screening in a Regional Health System: a
      Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 1733-40
LID - 10.1007/s11606-015-3349-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends 
      screening for osteoporosis with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) for women 
      aged >/= 65 years and younger women with increased risk. "Choosing Wisely"
      initiatives advise avoiding DXA screening in women younger than 65 years without 
      osteoporosis risk factors. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the extent to which
      DXA screening is used in accordance with USPSTF recommendations within a regional
      health system. DESIGN: This was a retrospective longitudinal cohort study within 
      13 primary care clinics in the Sacramento, CA region. PATIENTS: The study
      included 50,995 women aged 40-85 years without prior osteoporosis screening,
      diagnosis, or treatment attending primary care visits from 2006 to 2012, observed
      for a mean of 4.4 years. MAIN MEASURES: We examined incidence of DXA screening.
      Covariates included age, race/ethnicity, and osteoporosis risk factors (body mass
      index < 20, glucocorticoid use, secondary osteoporosis, prior high-risk facture, 
      rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol abuse, and current smoking). KEY RESULTS: Among
      previously unscreened women for whom the USPSTF recommends screening, 7-year
      cumulative incidence of DXA screening was 58.8 % among women aged 60-64 years
      with >/= 1 risk factor (95 % CI: 51.9-65.8 %), 57.8 % for women aged 65-74 years 
      (95 % CI: 55.6-60.0 %), and 42.7 % for women aged >/= 75 years (95 % CI:
      38.7-46.7 %). Among women for whom the USPSTF does not recommend screening,
      7-year cumulative incidence was 45.5 % among women aged 50-59 years (95 % CI
      44.1-46.9 %) and 58.6 % among women aged 60-64 years without risk factors (95 %
      CI 55.9-61.4 %). CONCLUSIONS: DXA screening was underused in women at increased
      fracture risk, including women aged >/= 65 years. Meanwhile, DXA screening was
      common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without
      osteoporosis risk factors. Interventions may be needed to augment the value of
      population screening for osteoporosis.

BTI - e-Interventions for Alcohol Misuse
AB  - Alcohol misuse is the third leading cause of preventable death in the United
      States and the third leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
      associated costs amount to more than 1% of the gross national product in high-
      and middle-income countries. Substance use disorders, including alcohol use
      disorder (AUD), are among the most common and most costly conditions in Veterans 
      presenting for treatment in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system.
      Traditional treatment for AUD-intensive, but time-limited initial interventions, 
      then less intensive follow-up care-can be prohibitive because of barriers such as
      sufficient funding, time, and adequately trained personnel. Even screening and
      brief interventions for less severe alcohol misuse, which have been recommended
      by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), require financial and
      clinical resource investments that can be problematic. Thus, electronic
      interventions (e-interventions) may prove a useful way to extend the reach of
      traditional interventions for alcohol misuse or AUD. Eighty-seven percent of the 
      U.S. population uses the Internet. Thus, e-interventions have the potential to
      reach those individuals with drinking problems who wish to remain anonymous;
      those who live at great distance from, cannot afford, or have little time for
      traditional therapy; and shift workers who need treatment to be available during 
      non-standard business hours. Given that Veterans can encounter most, if not all, 
      of these barriers to accessing care for alcohol misuse, e-interventions may prove
      a promising new avenue, especially for the younger, more Internet-savvy Veterans 
      returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although prior reviews have evaluated
      computer-based interventions for alcohol misuse, our study includes a broader
      array of e-interventions, evaluates effects separately for student and
      non-student populations, and focuses on studies that report longer term,
      clinically important outcomes. In order to inform policy on alcohol misuse for
      VHA, we offer a systematic review of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      assessing CD-ROM-based, web-based, interactive voice response (IVR), or mobile
      applications of e-interventions for alcohol misuse. We assess for changes in
      alcohol consumption, effects on medical health, and social or legal consequences 
      of alcohol misuse.

TI  - Alcohol brief intervention for hospitalized veterans with hazardous drinking:
      protocol for a 3-arm randomized controlled efficacy trial.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/s13722-015-0033-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Various hospital accreditation and quality assurance entities in the 
      United States have approved and endorsed performance measures promoting alcohol
      brief intervention (BI) for hospitalized individuals who screen positive for
      unhealthy alcohol use, the spectrum of use ranging from hazardous use to alcohol 
      use disorders. These performance measures have been controversial due to the
      limited and equivocal evidence for the efficacy of BI among hospitalized
      individuals. The few BI trials conducted with hospital inpatients vary widely in 
      methodological quality. While the majority of these studies indicate limited to
      no effects of BI in this population, none have been designed to account for the
      most pervasive methodological issue in BI studies presumed to drive study
      findings towards the null: assessment reactivity (AR). METHODS/DESIGN: This is a 
      three-arm, single-site, randomized controlled trial of BI for hospitalized
      patients at a large academic medical center affiliated with the U.S. Department
      of Veterans Affairs who use alcohol at hazardous levels but do not have an
      alcohol use disorder. Participants are randomized to one of three study
      conditions. Study Arm 1 receives a three-part alcohol BI. Study Arm 2 receives
      attention control. To account for potential AR, Study Arm 3 receives AC with
      limited assessment. Primary outcomes will include the number of standard
      drinks/week and binge drinking episodes reported in the 30-day period prior to a 
      final measurement visit obtained 6 months after hospital discharge. Additional
      outcomes will include readiness to change drinking behavior and number of adverse
      consequences of alcohol use. To assess differences in primary outcomes across the
      three arms, we will use mixed-effects regression models that account for a
      patient's repeated measures over the timepoints and clustering within medical
      units. Intervention implementation will be assessed by: a) review of intervention
      audio recordings to characterize barriers to intervention fidelity; and b)
      feasibility of participant recruitment, enrollment, and follow-up. DISCUSSION:
      The results of this methodologically rigorous trial will provide greater
      justification for or against the use of BI performance measures in the inpatient 
      setting and inform organizational responses to BI-related hospital accreditation 
      and performance measures. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01602172.

TI  - Metadoxine improves the three- and six-month survival rates in patients with
      severe alcoholic hepatitis.
PG  - 4975-85
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i16.4975 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the impact of metadoxine (MTD) on the 3- and 6-mo survival of
      patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH). METHODS: This study was an
      open-label clinical trial, performed at the "Hospital General de Mexico, Dr.
      Eduardo Liceaga". We randomized 135 patients who met the criteria for severe AH
      into the following groups: 35 patients received prednisone (PDN) 40 mg/d, 35
      patients received PDN+MTD 500 mg three times daily, 33 patients received
      pentoxifylline (PTX) 400 mg three times daily, and 32 patients received PTX+MTD
      500 mg three times daily. The duration of the treatment for all of the groups was
      30 d. RESULTS: In the groups treated with the MTD, the survival rate was higher
      at 3 mo (PTX+MTD 59.4% vs PTX 33.3%, P = 0.04; PDN+MTD 68.6% vs PDN 20%, P =
      0.0001) and at 6 mo (PTX+MTD 50% vs PTX 18.2%, P = 0.01; PDN+MTD 48.6% vs PDN
      20%, P = 0.003) than in the groups not treated with MTD. A relapse in alcohol
      intake was the primary independent factor predicting mortality at 6 mo. The
      patients receiving MTD maintained greater abstinence than those who did not
      receive it (74.5% vs 59.4%, P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: MTD improves the 3- and 6-mo
      survival rates in patients with severe AH. Alcohol abstinence is a key factor for
      survival in these patients. The patients who received the combination therapy
      with MTD were more likely to maintain abstinence than those who received
      monotherapy with either PDN or PTX.

AB  - Across developed countries, experimentation with alcohol, tobacco, and other
      drugs often begins in the early adolescent years. Several evidence-based programs
      have been developed to prevent adolescent substance use. Many of the most
      rigorously tested and empirically supported prevention programs were initially
      developed and tested in the United States. Increasingly, these interventions are 
      being adopted for use in Europe and throughout the world. This paper reports on a
      large-scale comprehensive initiative designed to select, adapt, implement, and
      sustain an evidence-based drug abuse prevention program in Italy. As part of a
      large-scale regionally funded collaboration in the Lombardy region of Italy, we
      report on processes through which a team of stakeholders selected, translated and
      culturally adapted, planned, implemented and evaluated the Life Skills Training
      (LST) school-based drug abuse prevention program, an evidence-based intervention 
      developed in the United States. We discuss several challenges and lessons learned
      and implications for prevention practitioners and researchers attempting to
      undertake similar international dissemination projects. We review several
      published conceptual models designed to promote the replication and widespread
      dissemination of effective programs, and discuss their strengths and limitations 
      in the context of planning and implementing a complex, large-scale real-world
      dissemination effort.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A significant segment of the Latino migrant worker population in the 
      United States is at high risk for alcohol abuse and related risk behaviors.
      Information about the prevalence of alcohol use and abuse and its association
      with sociodemographic and psychological variables is needed for designing
      effective intervention prevention strategies. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were 
      drawn from a baseline assessment that was part of a randomized controlled trial
      of 278 Latino migrant workers (LMWs) conducted between 2008 and 2010. RESULTS:
      About one-third (32%) of participants engaged in heavy drinking in the past 30
      days prior to baseline interview. More females than males reported no alcohol use
      in the past 30 days (53.5% vs. 20.5%). On the other hand, more males reported
      drinking every day or nearly (25.2% vs. 7.1%). Five factors-gender, country of
      origin, relationship status, living arrangements, and acculturation-were
      significantly associated with frequency of alcohol consumption. Multivariate
      analyses indicated that gender, country of origin, education attainment,
      relationship status, living arrangement, living with children, length of stay in 
      the US, religious beliefs, acculturation, and depression were associated with
      frequent heavy drinking, alcohol abuse/dependence, and unprotected sex under the 
      influence of alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant variation in alcohol use 
      among Latino migrant workers. Although a substantial proportion of this
      population abstains from alcohol, an equally substantial proportion report levels
      of alcohol use that pose significant risk. More research is needed to better
      understand drinking patterns in this community in order to design prevention
      strategies specifically tailored for this population.

TI  - Adapting an evidence-based HIV behavioral intervention for South African couples.
PG  - 6
LID - 10.1186/s13011-015-0005-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In South Africa, heterosexual couples are at risk for HIV infection
      and transmission through substance use, gender-based violence and traditional
      gender roles, and sex risk behaviors such as having multiple partners and unsafe 
      sex. METHODS: To address these interconnected HIV risks among heterosexual
      couples, we used the ADAPT framework to modify an existing, efficacious women's
      HIV prevention intervention (the Western Cape Women's Health CoOp) to include
      components of an evidence-based couple's intervention from the United States
      (Project Connect) and components from the Men as Partners program that has been
      used successfully in South Africa. We conducted focus groups with men, women and 
      couples, and obtained feedback from a long-standing Community Collaborative Board
      (CCB) to guide the synthesis of elements of these three interventions into a new 
      intervention. We then piloted the adapted intervention for feasibility and
      acceptability. RESULTS: The new intervention is called the Couples' Health CoOp. 
      This intervention targets men who use alcohol and other drugs and engage in
      unprotected sex, and their main female sex partners. The intervention addresses
      substance use, sex risk, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, gender
      roles, gender-based violence, communication skills, and goal-setting activities
      to increase sexy (eroticize) safe-sex behaviors. The Couples' Health CoOp also
      includes "voices" from the focus group members to ground the intervention in the 
      experiences of these at-risk couples. In addition, it utilizes a participant
      handbook that reiterates workshop content and includes homework assignments for
      couples to complete together to increase problem-solving skills within their
      relationship, and to improve their sexual relationship and help sustain HIV
      risk-reduction strategies. All of these adaptations were based on participants'
      suggestions made during formative work and pilot testing. CONCLUSIONS: The
      Couples' Health CoOp is a couple-based HIV prevention intervention that targets
      alcohol and other drug use to reduce sexual risk, reduce gender-based violence
      and offer alternatives for conflict resolution, promote healthy relationships,
      and modify traditional gender roles in South Africa. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER:

TI  - Development and validation of a clinical score for predicting risk of adenoma at 
      screening colonoscopy.
PG  - 913-20
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-1321 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, no clinical tools use demographic and risk factor
      information to predict the risk of finding an adenoma in individuals undergoing
      colon cancer screening. Such a tool would be valuable for identifying those who
      would most benefit from screening colonoscopy. METHODS: We used baseline data
      from men and women who underwent screening colonoscopy from the randomized,
      multicenter National Colonoscopy Study (NCS) to develop and validate an adenoma
      risk model. The study, conducted at three sites in the United States
      (Minneapolis, MN; Seattle, WA; and Shreveport, LA) asked all participants to
      complete baseline questionnaires on clinical risk factors and family history.
      Model parameters estimated from logistic regression yielded an area under the
      receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCC) used to assess prediction.
      RESULTS: Five hundred forty-one subjects were included in the development model, 
      and 1,334 in the validation of the risk score. Variables in the prediction of
      adenoma risk for colonoscopy screening were age (likelihood ratio test for
      overall contribution to model, P < 0.001), male sex (P < 0.001), body mass index 
      (P < 0.001), family history of at least one first-degree relative with colorectal
      cancer (P = 0.036), and smoking history (P < 0.001). The adjusted AUROCC of 0.67 
      [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.61-0.74] for the derivation cohort was not
      statistically significantly different from that in the validation cohort. The
      adjusted AUROCC for the entire cohort was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.67). CONCLUSION:
      We developed and validated a simple well-calibrated risk score. IMPACT: This tool
      may be useful for estimating risk of adenomas in screening eligible men and
      women.

TI  - Improving patient knowledge and safe use of opioids: a randomized controlled
      trial.
PG  - 331-9
LID - 10.1111/acem.12600 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The use of opioid analgesics in the United States has significantly
      increased in recent years. However, there is minimal consensus on what discharge 
      counseling should accompany these high-risk prescriptions and large variations in
      what is done in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect 
      of a dual-modality (written and spoken) literacy-appropriate educational strategy
      on patients' knowledge of and safe use of opioid analgesics. METHODS: This was a 
      prospective, randomized controlled trial. Consecutive discharged patients at an
      urban academic ED (>88,000 visits) with new prescriptions for
      hydrocodone-acetaminophen were enrolled. Patients were randomized to receive
      either usual care or the educational intervention. The educational intervention
      was a one-page information sheet about hydrocodone-acetaminophen, which was both 
      given to the patients and read aloud by the research assistant (nonblinded).
      Follow-up phone calls were conducted 4 to 7 days after the visit to assess
      patient knowledge about the medication and self-report of activities associated
      with safety of use (e.g., double-dipping with acetaminophen, storage, use with
      alcohol or while driving). RESULTS: A total of 274 patients were enrolled; 210
      completed follow-up (110 usual care and 100 intervention). No significant
      differences in baseline characteristics emerged between the study arms; 42% were 
      male, and 51% were white, with a median age of 43 years. Half of patients had
      non-back pain orthopedic injuries (49.5%). On follow-up, overall knowledge was
      poor, with only 28% able to name both active ingredients in the medication. The
      intervention group had better knowledge of precautions related to taking
      additional acetaminophen (usual care 18.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.9% 
      to 25.5% vs. intervention 38%, 95% CI = 28.3% to 47.7%; difference = 27.6, 95% CI
      of difference = 21.5 to 33.7) and knowledge of side effects (usual care median = 
      1, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 2 vs. intervention median = 2, IQR = 1 to 2; p 
      < 0.0001). Additionally, those who received the intervention were less likely to 
      have reported driving within 6 hours after taking hydrocodone (usual care 13.6%, 
      95% CI = 7.2% to 20% vs. intervention 3%, 95% CI = -0.3% to 6.3%; difference =
      10.6, 95% CI of difference = 3.4 to 17.9). There was no difference between groups
      related to knowledge about drinking alcohol while taking hydrocodone (overall
      18.1%) or knowledge that the opioid could be addictive (overall 72.4%).
      CONCLUSIONS: This simple strategy improved several, but not all, aspects of
      patient knowledge and resulted in fewer patients in the intervention arm driving 
      while taking hydrocodone. Integration of a patient education document into
      conversations about opioids holds promise for improving patient knowledge about
      these high-risk medications.

AB  - The prevalence of alcohol and other drug use is high among college students.
      Reducing their consumption will likely be beneficial for society as a whole.
      Computer and web-based interventions are promising for providing behaviorally
      based information. The present study compared the efficacy of three interventions
      (computerized screening and motivational intervention [ASSIST/MBIc],
      non-computerized screening and motivational intervention [ASSIST/MBIi], and
      screening only [control]) in college students in Curitiba, Brazil. A convenience 
      sample of 458 students scored moderate and high risk on the ASSIST. They were
      then randomized into the three arms of the randomized controlled trial
      (ASSIST/MBIc, ASSIST/MBIi [interview], and assessment-only [control]) and
      assessed at baseline and 3 months later. The ASSIST involvement scores decreased 
      at follow-up compared with baseline in the three groups, suggesting that any
      intervention is better than no intervention. For alcohol, the specific
      involvement scores decreased to a low level of risk in the three groups and the
      MBIc group showed a positive outcome compared with control, and the scores for
      each question were reduced in the two intervention groups compared to baseline.
      For tobacco, involvement scores decreased in the three groups, but they
      maintained moderate risk. For marijuana, a small positive effect was observed in 
      the ASSIST/MBIi and control groups. The ASSIST/MBIc may be a good alternative to 
      interview interventions because it is easy to administer, students frequently use
      such computer-based technologies, and individually tailored content can be
      delivered in the absence of a counselor.

TI  - An observational study of buprenorphine treatment of the prescription opioid
      dependent pain patient.
PG  - 357-61
LID - 10.1111/ajad.12198 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In some countries, particularly the United States and 
      Canada, there has been a growing problem of opioid dependence associated with the
      treatment of chronic pain. Controversy exists regarding the efficacy and safety
      of opioid therapy, particularly in high doses for extended periods of time. This 
      study reports on the outcome of chronic pain patients treated with buprenorphine 
      in an outpatient psychiatric consultation clinic. METHODS: Forty three
      consecutive outpatient clinic chronic pain patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of
      opioid dependence and treated with buprenorphine during a 3-year period were
      monitored for follow-up periods of up to 5 years. All subjects were dependent on 
      drugs prescribed for pain and were divided into two groups: those who had a
      history of abuse of alcohol or drugs and those who did not Historical, physical, 
      demographic, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: The majority of patients
      were male, not working, and between the ages of 45-60. Follow-up revealed that
      treatment with buprenorphine was effective. Most patients had improved pain with 
      treatment of the opioid dependence. There were no differences between those with 
      or without a history of substance abuse. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      often improved with much less preoccupation with pain, expressing great
      satisfaction with buprenorphine treatment. SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: Buprenorphine
      is an effective tool when treating the opioid-dependent chronic pain patient.

TI  - Patient profile and treatment satisfaction of Brazilian leprosy patients in a
      clinical trial of uniform six-month multidrug therapy (U-MDT/CT-BR).
PG  - 267-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the profile of patients who participated in the Randomised
      Clinical Trial for Uniform Multidrug Therapy for Leprosy Patients in Brazil
      (U-MDT/CT-BR) and determine the level of satisfaction with a uniform therapy
      regimen, especially among paucibacillary patients. DESIGN: This is a descriptive 
      cross-sectional epidemiologic study nested in the wider U-MDT/CT-BR. The study
      was conducted using a convenience sample composed of patients from the Dona
      Libania Dermatology Centre in Fortaleza, Ceara and from the Alfredo da Matta
      Foundation in Manaus, Amazonas in Brazil. The absolute and relative frequencies
      of categorical variables and the median age were calculated. Hypothesis testing
      was done using the Chi-squared and Mann-Whitney tests with a 0.05 level of
      significance. RESULTS: Of the 859 patients included in the clinical trial, 342
      were interviewed. The majority of patients were male (58.2%) and multibacillary
      (78.3%) with a median age of 42 (7-65) years. Most of the interviewees had not
      completed primary education (48.0%), earned an income below three times the
      minimum wage (53.8%), were non-smokers (85.1%), did not regularly consume alcohol
      (88.3%), had not experienced any leprosy-related discrimination (69.2%) and
      showed a basic knowledge of the disease. With regards to paucibacillary patients,
      87.8% and 90.9% of the PB U-MDT and PB R-MDT groups, respectively, indicated that
      they had not thought of defaulting treatment at any time. On a satisfaction scale
      of 1-5 (with five as the highest score), 92.7% of PB U-MDT and 100.0% of PB R-MDT
      patients gave a mark between three and five. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that
      the introduction of clofazimine into the therapeutic regimen did not diminish the
      level of treatment satisfaction among PB patients.

TI  - Primary care residents lack comfort and experience with alcohol screening and
      brief intervention: a multi-site survey.
PG  - 790-6
LID - 10.1007/s11606-015-3184-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately one in six adults in the United States (U.S.) binge
      drinks. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that primary care
      physicians screen patients for such hazardous alcohol use, and when warranted,
      deliver a brief intervention. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine primary care
      residents' current practices, perceived barriers and confidence with conducting
      alcohol screening and brief interventions (SBI). DESIGN: This was a multi-site,
      cross-sectional survey conducted from March 2010 through December 2012.
      PARTICIPANTS: We invited all residents in six primary care residency programs
      (three internal medicine programs and three family medicine programs) to
      participate. Of 244 residents, 210 completed the survey (response rate 86 %).
      MAIN MEASURES: Our survey assessed residents' alcohol screening practices
      (instruments used and frequency of screening), perceived barriers to discussing
      alcohol, brief intervention content, and self-rated ability to help hazardous
      drinkers. To determine the quality of brief interventions delivered, we examined 
      how often residents reported including the three key recommended elements of
      feedback, advice, and goal-setting. KEY RESULTS: Most residents (60 %, 125/208)
      reported "usually" or "always" screening patients for alcohol misuse at the
      initial clinic visit, but few residents routinely screened patients at subsequent
      acute-care (17 %, 35/208) or chronic-care visits (33 %, 68/208). Only 19 %
      (39/210) of residents used screening instruments capable of detecting binge
      drinking. The most frequently reported barrier to SBI was lack of adequate
      training (54 %, 108/202), and only 21 % (43/208) of residents felt confident they
      could help at -risk drinkers. When residents did perform a brief intervention,
      only 24 % (49/208) "usually" or "always" included the three recommended elements.
      CONCLUSIONS: A minority of residents in this multi-site study appropriately
      screen or intervene with at-risk alcohol users. To equip residents to effectively
      address hazardous alcohol use, there is a critical need for educational and
      clinic interventions to support alcohol-related SBI.

TI  - Smoking cessation and care management for veterans with posttraumatic stress
      disorder: a study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 46
LID - 10.1186/s12913-015-0706-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness and
      mortality in the United States. Individuals with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
      (PTSD) have smoking rates higher than that of others and fewer individuals with
      PTSD have quit smoking. This randomized controlled trial was designed to test the
      effectiveness of integrating telehealth care management and smoking cessation
      with motivational interviewing for Veterans with PTSD. METHODS/DESIGN: All
      smokers with PTSD, regardless of their desire to quit, were invited to
      participate. Enrollment occurred between November 2009 and April 2013. Target
      enrollment was 120 participants. Enrolled participants were randomized to either 
      the control group, receiving usual care including a telehealth PTSD program, with
      a device that delivered PTSD information and in-home care management, or the
      intervention group, which included (1) a telehealth PTSD program, (2)
      motivational interviewing-based smoking cessation curricula via the telehealth
      device, and (3) weekly motivational interviewing counseling phone calls. Outcomes
      are self-reported 24-hour quit attempts, progression along the stages of change
      and 7-day point prevalence quit smoking rates for the intervention group compared
      to usual care alone. Secondary outcomes include participants' perception of care 
      coordination, patient satisfaction with motivational interviewing, PTSD symptoms,
      pain, depression and quality of life. DISCUSSION: Motivational interviewing has
      been shown to increase readiness for change and smoking cessation care has been
      shown to be more successful when incorporated into in-person mental health care. 
      Our study builds on previous studies. It integrates a written smoking cessation
      curriculum and phone-based motivational interviewing counseling into an
      established PTSD home telehealth care coordination program. This paper describes 
      the design and methods of our randomized control trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

BTI - Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Systematic Evidence Review for the
      U.S. Preventive Services Task Force
AB  - We conducted this systematic review to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
      Force (USPSTF) in updating its recommendation on screening for high blood
      pressure (BP) in nonpregnant adults. We searched relevant databases and
      literature sources from 2003 to June 17, 2013 to identify existing systematic
      reviews. For Key Questions (KQs) 1 and 5, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane
      Central Register for Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cumulative Index to
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature from 2003 to February 24, 2014 to locate
      relevant studies. For KQs 2 and 3, we searched MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane 
      Central Register for Controlled Clinical Trials from January 1, 1992 to February 
      24, 2014 for relevant studies. For KQ 4, we searched MEDLINE and PubMed from
      January 1, 1966 to February 24, 2014 to identify longitudinal cohort studies of
      rescreening. We conducted a dual independent review of 19,309 abstracts and 1,171
      full-text articles against a priori inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two
      investigators also independently critically appraised each included article using
      criteria defined by the USPSTF and supplemented with criteria from the Quality
      Assessment of Studies of Diagnostic Accuracy II, the Quality in Prognosis Studies
      tool, and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for diagnostic accuracy (KQs 2 and 3),
      prognostic (KQ 3), and observational (KQs 4 and 5) studies, respectively. We
      resolved discrepancies through discussion and consultation with a third reviewer,
      when necessary. We included only fair- or good-quality studies. For KQs 1 and 5, 
      we qualitatively summarized results because of the small number of included
      studies. For KQ 2, we calculated the diagnostic accuracy of office-based BP
      measurement (OBPM) devices and protocols using the result from the most commonly 
      recommended device (i.e., manual mercury sphygmomanometer) or protocol component 
      (e.g., no caffeine) as the reference standard. We qualitatively summarized the
      results. For the prognosis component of KQ 3, we grouped outcomes into the
      categories of cardiovascular (CV), stroke, and cardiac events. We combined fatal 
      and nonfatal events within these outcome categories. Risk was consistently
      expressed as a hazard ratio per increment in BP measurement across all included
      studies. Risk results for CV outcomes by BP measurement method at baseline were
      visualized in forest plots of hazard ratios. For diagnostic accuracy
      calculations, we used the BP measurement method that best predicted CV outcomes
      (i.e., ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) as the reference standard. We
      qualitatively evaluated how patient or study characteristics influenced
      diagnostic accuracy. For KQ 4, we pooled incidence rates for the overall
      populations in included studies to generate a weighted mean incidence at various 
      rescreening intervals, which were categorized into 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years. We
      qualitatively examined direct evidence from subgroup results reported within
      studies to address the influence of patient characteristics. One randomized,
      controlled trial (39 clusters; n=140,642) of a Canadian BP screening program that
      targeted adults age 65 years or older reported 3.02 fewer annual hospital
      admissions for cardiovascular disease per 1,000 persons in the intervention group
      compared with the no screening group. When the trial data were analyzed by number
      of unique persons with hospital admissions, there was a significant relative
      reduction only in the individual outcome of acute myocardial infarction (rate
      ratio, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79 to 0.99]; p=0.03). Few studies reported the necessary
      data to allow us to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of specific BP measurement
      methods or protocols. In three studies, automated oscillometric office BP results
      showed a range of sensitivity (51%-68%) for elevated BP, defined by manual
      mercury sphygmomanometry, but more consistent specificity (97%-98%) and positive 
      predictive value (PPV) (76%-84%). Three different diagnostic accuracy studies
      examined the impact of recommended protocols on OBPM. In one study, a single BP
      measurement had high sensitivity (0.95) but only moderate PPV (0.76) compared
      with the average of second and third BP measurements. Two small studies in
      normotensive subjects found that leg crossing elevated BP measurements within the
      normal range and caffeine ingestion falsely elevated BP measurements above the
      hypertensive threshold in 17% of normotensive participants. We first evaluated
      the predictive value of home BP monitoring (HBPM) and ABPM methods for long-term 
      CV events compared with OBPM. Eleven studies reported that daytime, nighttime,
      and 24-hour ABPM predicted stroke and other fatal and nonfatal CV events
      independently of OBPM. While the results of five studies suggest similar results 
      for HBPM, too few studies are available to draw firm conclusions. Evidence from
      one study comparing HBPM with ABPM was insufficient to allow us to draw
      conclusions. Limited evidence suggested that cardiovascular disease outcomes for 
      the patient subgroup with isolated clinic hypertension (elevated OBPM and normal 
      ABPM) are more similar to those of normotensive subjects at baseline than those
      with sustained hypertension. The proportion of participants with an elevated BP
      measurement who are normotensive upon confirmatory testing by ABPM (or HBPM)
      ranged from 5 to 65 percent across all studies. This population has
      false-positive results when screened by OBPM methods, or "isolated clinic
      hypertension." Increasing baseline OBPM was associated with increasing PPV for
      ABPM-confirmed hypertension. As a result, the likelihood of misdiagnosis of
      hypertension based only on screening measurement is greater as measurements
      approach the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension. We did not qualitatively 
      detect any associations between reported race/ethnicity, sex, or smoking.
      Estimates of the weighted mean incidence of hypertension at yearly intervals less
      than 6 years were derived from a small number of studies (except at 5 years) with
      highly variable results at each interval. The weighted mean incidence at 5 years 
      of 14 percent, for example, actually ranged from 2 to 28 percent. In the small
      number of studies that used a separate confirmation step, a significant
      proportion of apparent incident hypertension cases were not confirmed. Thus,
      overall estimates at yearly intervals based on unconfirmed incident hypertension 
      are likely to be falsely high. Variation in incidence estimates across studies
      also likely reflects differences in criteria for diagnosis, as well as
      differences in age, sex, baseline BP, and obesity status of the populations
      studied. Hypertension incidence increased as much as two- to four-fold between a 
      younger (ages 18 to 40/45 years) and older (ages 40/45 to 60/65) age group,
      respectively. Within-study hypertension incidence consistently tripled when
      comparing participants with initial optimal versus normal BP, and was
      approximately doubled in those with initial normal versus high-normal BP.
      Incidence was generally higher in men than women, especially men in younger
      populations. While incidence was also two-fold higher in overweight persons and
      three-fold higher in obese persons compared with those of normal weight, it was
      not increased in smokers compared with nonsmokers or former smokers. African
      Americans had a consistently higher incidence of hypertension at rescreening than
      white participants. Four trials found no significant differences in psychological
      distress or quality of life after patients were labeled as hypertensive or
      prehypertensive. One cohort study reported significantly increased absenteeism up
      to 4 years after labeling compared with the year before. Three cohort studies
      reported significant sleep disturbances associated with ABPM use and one study
      reported that a significant proportion of ABPM users experienced pain, skin
      irritation, and overall discomfort. Discomfort and restrictions in daily
      activities were more frequently reported with ABPM than HBPM in one study.
      Despite recent emphasis on the instability of single BP measurements and the need
      for multiple valid measurements to assess a patient's actual elevated BP
      exposure, high-quality comparable diagnostic accuracy studies are not common.
      Given recent recognition of the impact of overdiagnosis in many diseases, the
      widespread availability of automated BP devices with variable performance, and
      the prevalence of essential hypertension in the United States, further research
      is needed to guide primary care clinicians and consumers. ABPM (24-hour, daytime,
      or nighttime) is a better predictor of long-term CV outcomes than OBPM (usually
      manual sphygmomanometry) and should be considered the reference standard for
      evaluating noninvasive BP measurements. A small body of evidence suggests, but
      does not confirm, that HBPM can serve as a similar predictor of outcomes. Initial
      screening by office-based methods (manual sphygmomanometry or automated
      oscillometric devices) variably predicts hypertension as defined by ABPM,
      resulting in a significant population with isolated clinic hypertension. Limited 
      evidence suggests that patients with isolated clinic hypertension have outcomes
      that are more similar to normotensive than hypertensive persons. Failure to
      confirm initial elevated OBPM results may result in misdiagnosis and
      overtreatment. Limited evidence suggests that repeated measurements and improved 
      procedural control (e.g., by automation) may improve the diagnostic accuracy of
      OBPM when used to screen for high BP or confirm a diagnosis of hypertension.
      Studies of rescreening intervals at up to 6 years found a higher incidence of
      hypertension overall and at shorter intervals for persons with BP in the
      high-normal range, older adults, persons with an above normal BMI, and African
      Americans. These studies showed much lower incidence at longer rescreening
      intervals up to 6 years in persons without these risk factors.

TI  - Preventing alcohol-exposed pregnancy among an American Indian/Alaska Native
      population: effect of a screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment 
      intervention.
PG  - 126-35
LID - 10.1111/acer.12607 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the result of alcohol-exposed
      pregnancies (AEP) and believed to be the leading known cause of developmental
      disabilities in the United States. Our objective was to determine whether a
      culturally targeted Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
      (SBIRT) intervention may reduce risky drinking and vulnerability to AEP among
      American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) women in Southern California. METHODS:
      Southern California AIAN women of childbearing age who completed a survey
      including questions regarding alcohol consumption and contraceptive use were
      randomized into intervention or treatment as usual groups where the former group 
      completed an online SBIRT intervention, and were followed up at 1, 3, and 6
      months postintervention. RESULTS: Of 263 women recruited and 247 with follow-up
      data, one-third were at high risk of having an AEP at baseline. Both treatment
      groups decreased self-reported risky drinking behavior (drinks per week, p <
      0.001; frequency of heavy episodic [binge] drinking episodes per 2 weeks, p =
      0.017 and risk of AEP p < 0.001 at 6 months postintervention) in the follow-up
      period. There was no difference between treatment groups. Baseline factors
      associated with decreased risk of an AEP at follow-up included the perception
      that other women in their peer group consumed a greater number of drinks per
      week, having reported a greater number of binge episodes in the past 2 weeks, and
      depression/impaired functionality. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in assessment alone
      may have been sufficient to encourage behavioral change even without the
      web-based SBIRT intervention. Randomization to the SBIRT did not result in a
      significantly different change in risky drinking behaviors. The importance of
      perception of other women's drinking and one's own depression/functionality may
      have implications for future interventions.

TI  - Risk factors for alcohol relapse following orthotopic liver transplantation: a
      systematic review.
PG  - 21-35
LID - 10.1016/j.psym.2014.09.006 [doi]
LID - S0033-3182(14)00157-1 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Each year, 5000-6000 individuals undergo orthotopic liver
      transplantation (OLT) in the United States, and of these, nearly 18% have
      alcoholic liver disease. Relapse to alcohol occurs in more than 40% of patients
      with OLT for alcoholic liver disease. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify factors
      that predict relapse to alcohol or medication nonadherence following OLT in
      patients with alcoholic liver disease and to review what randomized clinical
      interventions have addressed these factors following OLT. Our hypothesis was that
      there would be factors before and after OLT that predict relapse to alcohol
      following OLT, and that these, if targeted, might improve sobriety and associated
      outcomes of adherence with medications and appointments. METHODS: We performed a 
      review (focusing on articles published since 2004) with PubMed and MEDLINE
      searches using the following search terms: liver transplantation, recidivism,
      alcohol relapse, and predictors of alcohol relapse. We supplemented the online
      searches with manual reviews of article reference lists and selected relevant
      articles for further review by author consensus. RESULTS: In largely white
      populations, prospective studies document that shorter length of
      pretransplantation sobriety is a significant predictor of time to first drink and
      time to binge use. Presence of psychiatric comorbidity, high score on
      standardized High-risk Alcoholism Relapse Scale, and diagnosis of Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) alcohol dependence are
      predictive of posttransplantation alcohol relapse. Pretransplantation alcohol use
      history variables (e.g., family history of alcoholism) reliably discriminate
      between complete abstainers and those who drink, while medical and psychosocial
      characteristics at early post-liver transplantation period (e.g., more bodily
      pain) maximally discriminate patterns of alcohol use. Alcoholic individuals with 
      early-onset, rapidly accelerating moderate use and early-onset, continuously
      increasing heavy use have more than double the prevalence of steatohepatitis or
      rejection on biopsy and graft failure and more frequent mortality resulting from 
      recurrent alcoholic liver disease than late-onset (i.e., peak of heaviest
      drinking at 6y posttransplantation) alcohol users do. Fortunately,
      pretransplantation screening combined with a structured pretransplantation
      management program and a 12-step program attendance reduced recidivism. No
      randomized clinical trials have been performed that target pretransplantation
      risk factors in individuals with alcoholic liver disease before or after OLT to
      improve post-OLT outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Recent research findings suggest that
      screening can reveal individuals who are vulnerable to alcohol relapse and
      targeted intervention can prevent their relapse to alcohol. Based on existing
      addiction treatments (e.g., relapse prevention plan construction), randomized
      clinical trials tailored to post-OLT patients should be conducted to improve
      their survival and quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study assessed college student health providers' use of
      Motivational Interviewing (MI) with tobacco users, as well as their beliefs about
      the use of brief interventions to help college student tobacco users quit. MI is 
      recommended by the United States Public Health Service to increase tobacco users'
      willingness to quit. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 83 clinicians from
      health clinics at 7 different universities in North Carolina. METHODS:
      Paper-and-pencil baseline survey from a cluster randomized trial of college
      student health clinicians. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of respondents reported
      always or usually using MI during the past month for tobacco-using patients not
      ready to make a quit attempt. Student health providers also reported information 
      with regards to their beliefs about tobacco cessation treatment, barriers to
      intervening with patients, and confidence in motivating students to consider
      quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the need to encourage clinicians' use of
      motivationally focused interventions with student tobacco users. [Table: see

TI  - Differential environmental exposure among non-Indigenous Canadians as a function 
      of sex/gender and race/ethnicity variables: a scoping review.
PG  - e438-44
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the extent, range and types of studies of differential
      environmental chemical exposures among non-Indigenous Canadians as a function of 
      sex/gender and race/ethnicity. METHODS: Computerized database searches were
      performed from November to December 2013 using Medline, Embase, CAB Abstracts,
      Proquest and Scopus to identify relevant studies of environmental exposures among
      non-Indigenous adults aged >/=18 years in Canada published between 1993 and 2013.
      Articles were identified for full-text review based on a screening of titles and 
      abstracts and were excluded during this initial review if they focused on
      environmental exposures in the following populations: 1) Indigenous populations, 
      2) individuals &lt;15 years of age, 3) pregnant women and associated negative
      birth outcomes, or 4) non-Canadian populations. Articles were also excluded if
      the primary focus was on exposures to environmental tobacco smoke, non-chemical
      occupational hazards, infectious diseases, noise and/or radiation. A full-text
      review of 78 identified articles systematically assessed how sex/gender and
      race/ethnicity were considered. SYNTHESIS: Although 59% of studies stratified
      results by sex, less than half of these offered any explanation of differential
      exposures. Eighteen of the 78 studies (23%) used terms related to race/ethnicity 
      in their participant descriptions. Of the studies that conducted subgroup
      analyses of exposure results by race/ethnicity (n=15), a total of 8 also included
      subgroup analysis by sex. Overall, 3 of the 78 (3%) articles reviewed analyzed
      environmental exposures as a function of sex/gender and race/ethnicity.
      CONCLUSION: The role of sex/gender and race/ethnicity in influencing
      environmental exposure levels among non-Indigenous Canadians has not been
      adequately addressed to date.

TI  - Health promotion interventions and policies addressing excessive alcohol use: a
      systematic review of national and global evidence as a guide to health-care
      reform in China.
PG  - 68-78
LID - 10.1111/add.12784 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Steady increases in alcohol consumption and related problems are likely to 
      accompany China's rapid epidemiological transition and profit-based marketing
      activities. We reviewed research on health promotion interventions and policies
      to address excessive drinking and to guide health-care reform. METHODS: We
      searched Chinese- and English-language databases and included 21 studies in China
      published between 1980 and 2013 that covered each policy area from the World
      Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy to Reduce the Harmful Use of Alcohol.
      We evaluated and compared preventive interventions to the global alcohol
      literature for cross-national applicability. RESULTS: In contrast with hundreds
      of studies in the global literature, 11 of 12 studies from mainland China were
      published in Chinese; six of 10 in English were on taxation from Taiwan or Hong
      Kong. Most studies demonstrated effectiveness in reducing excessive drinking, and
      some reported the reduction of health problems. Seven were randomized controlled 
      trials. Studies targeted schools, drink-driving, work-places, the health sector
      and taxation. CONCLUSIONS: China is the world's largest alcohol market, yet there
      has been little growth in alcohol policy research related to health promotion
      interventions over the past decade. Guided by a public health approach, the WHO
      Global Strategy and health reform experience in Russia, Australia, Mexico and the
      United States, China could improve its public health response through better
      coordination and implementation of surveillance and evidence-based research, and 
      through programmatic and legal responses such as public health law research,
      screening and early intervention within health systems and the implementation of 
      effective alcohol control strategies.

TI  - Proactive tobacco cessation outreach to smokers of low socioeconomic status: a
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 218-26
LID - 10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.6674 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Widening socioeconomic disparities in mortality in the United States 
      are largely explained by slower declines in tobacco use among smokers of low
      socioeconomic status (SES) than among those of higher SES, which points to the
      need for targeted tobacco cessation interventions. Documentation of smoking
      status in electronic health records (EHRs) provides the tools for health systems 
      to proactively offer tobacco treatment to socioeconomically disadvantaged
      smokers. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a proactive tobacco cessation strategy that
      addresses sociocontextual mediators of tobacco use for low-SES smokers. DESIGN,
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized clinical trial included
      low-SES adult smokers who described their race and/or ethnicity as black,
      Hispanic, or white and received primary care at 1 of 13 practices in the greater 
      Boston area (intervention group, n = 399; control group, n = 308). INTERVENTIONS:
      We analyzed EHRs to identify potentially eligible participants and then used
      interactive voice response (IVR) techniques to reach out to them. Consenting
      patients were randomized to either receive usual care from their own health care 
      team or enter an intervention program that included (1) telephone-based
      motivational counseling, (2) free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for 6 weeks,
      (3) access to community-based referrals to address sociocontextual mediators of
      tobacco use, and (4) integration of all these components into their normal health
      care through the EHR system. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Self-reported past-7-day
      tobacco abstinence 9 months after randomization ("quitting"), assessed by
      automated caller or blinded study staff. RESULTS: The intervention group had a
      higher quit rate than the usual care group (17.8% vs 8.1%; odds ratio, 2.5; 95%
      CI, 1.5-4.0; number needed to treat, 10). We examined whether use of intervention
      components was associated with quitting among individuals in the intervention
      group: individuals who participated in the telephone counseling were more likely 
      to quit than those who did not (21.2% vs 10.4%; P < .001). There was no
      difference in quitting by use of NRT. Quitting did not differ by a request for a 
      community referral, but individuals who used their referral were more likely to
      quit than those who did not (43.6% vs 15.3%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: Proactive, IVR-facilitated outreach enables engagement with low-SES
      smokers. Providing counseling, NRT, and access to community-based resources to
      address sociocontextual mediators among smokers reached in this setting is
      effective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01156610.

TI  - Barriers and promoters of an evidenced-based smoking cessation counseling during 
      prenatal care in Argentina and Uruguay.

AB  - In Argentina and Uruguay, 10.3 and 18.3 %, respectively, of pregnant women smoked
      in 2005. Brief cessation counseling, based on the 5A's model, has been effective 
      in different settings. This qualitative study aims to improve the understanding
      of factors influencing the provision of smoking cessation counseling during
      pregnancy in Argentina and Uruguay. In 2010, we obtained prenatal care
      providers', clinic directors', and pregnant smokers' opinions regarding barriers 
      and promoters to brief smoking cessation counseling in publicly-funded prenatal
      care clinics in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo, Uruguay. We interviewed
      six prenatal clinic directors, conducted focus groups with 46 health
      professionals and 24 pregnant smokers. Themes emerged from three issue areas:
      health professionals, health system, and patients. Health professional barriers
      to cessation counseling included inadequate knowledge and motivation, perceived
      low self-efficacy, and concerns about inadequate time and large workload. They
      expressed interest in obtaining a counseling script. Health system barriers
      included low prioritization of smoking cessation and a lack of clinic protocols
      to implement interventions. Pregnant smokers lacked information on the risks of
      prenatal smoking and underestimated the difficulty of smoking cessation. Having
      access to written materials and receiving cessation services during clinic
      waiting times were mentioned as promoters for the intervention. Women also were
      receptive to non-physician office staff delivering intervention components.
      Implementing smoking cessation counseling in publicly-funded prenatal care
      clinics in Argentina and Uruguay may require integrating counseling into routine 
      prenatal care and educating and training providers on best-practices approaches.

TI  - High-risk population in sporadic pancreatic adenocarcinoma: guidelines for
      screening.
PG  - 212-9

LID - S0022-4804(14)00624-6 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most deadly forms of cancer in
      the United States, with an annual incidence to death ratio of 0.92 because of the
      late stage at diagnosis. Identification of high-risk individuals (HRIs) that
      would be ideal for screening is needed to identify precursor lesions and small
      early stage disease. Those with a genetic predisposition have largely been
      identified, but little is known about those at high-risk for sporadic PC. This
      study asserts that a high-risk population does exist in sporadic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma and proposes simple guidelines for screening. METHODS: A
      systematic review was conducted of the literature regarding identification of and
      screening in high-risk groups. RESULTS: Those with the highest genetic risk of
      developing PC include those with hereditary pancreatitis (87 times more likely at
      age 55), Peutz-Jehgers syndrome (132 times more likely at age 50), p16-Leiden
      mutations (48 times more likely), and familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) kindreds
      (32 times more likely). Those with the highest risk of developing sporadic PC
      include those with new-onset diabetes older than 50 y and smoking history.
      CONCLUSIONS: Given that sporadic PC is the single largest patient population
      effected with this devastating disease, some form of screening should be
      initiated. Currently, the medical community does nothing to attempt early
      detection of PC. However, sufficient evidence now exists to begin a screening
      protocol in a high-risk cohort, which would be patients with new-onset diabetes
      older than 50 y and a smoking history.

TI  - Efficacy of a couple-based randomized controlled trial to help Latino fathers
      quit smoking during pregnancy and postpartum: the Parejas trial.
PG  - 379-85
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0841 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many Latinos in the United States smoke, they receive
      assistance to quit less often than non-Latinos. To address this disparity, we
      recruited Latino couples into a randomized controlled trial and provided a
      smoking cessation program during a teachable moment, when men's partners were
      pregnant. METHODS: We compared two interventions: (i) written materials plus
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to (ii) materials, NRT, and couple-based
      counseling that addressed smoking cessation and couples communication. We
      recruited 348 expectant fathers who smoked via their pregnant partners from
      county health departments. Our primary outcome was 7-day point prevalence smoking
      abstinence and was collected from November 2010 through April 2013 and analyzed
      in February 2014. RESULTS: We found high rates of cessation but no arm
      differences in smoking rates at the end of pregnancy (0.31 vs. 0.30, materials
      only vs. counseling, respectively) and 12 months after randomization (postpartum:
      0.39 vs. 0.38). We found high quit rates among nondaily smokers but no arm
      differences (0.43 vs. 0.46 in pregnancy and 0.52 vs. 0.48 postpartum). Among
      daily smokers, we found lower quit rates with no arm differences but effects
      favoring the intervention arm (0.13 vs. 0.16 in pregnancy and 0.17 vs. 0.24
      postpartum). CONCLUSIONS: A less intensive intervention promoted cessation equal 
      to more intensive counseling. Postpartum might be a more powerful time to promote
      cessation among Latino men. IMPACT: Less intensive interventions when delivered
      during teachable moments for Latino men could result in a high smoking cessation 
      rate and could reduce disparities.

TI  - Unintentional child neglect: literature review and observational study.
PG  - 253-9
LID - 10.1007/s11126-014-9328-0 [doi]
AB  - Child abuse is a problem that affects over six million children in the United
      States each year. Child neglect accounts for 78% of those cases. Despite this,
      the issue of child neglect is still not well understood, partially because child 
      neglect does not have a consistent, universally accepted definition. Some
      researchers consider child neglect and child abuse to be one in the same, while
      other researchers consider them to be conceptually different. Factors that make
      child neglect difficult to define include: (1) Cultural differences; motives must
      be taken into account because parents may believe they are acting in the child's 
      best interests based on cultural beliefs (2) the fact that the effect of child
      abuse is not always immediately visible; the effects of emotional neglect
      specifically may not be apparent until later in the child's development, and (3) 
      the large spectrum of actions that fall under the category of child abuse. Some
      of the risk factors for increased child neglect and maltreatment have been
      identified. These risk factors include socioeconomic status, education level,
      family composition, and the presence of dysfunction family characteristics.
      Studies have found that children from poorer families and children of less
      educated parents are more likely to sustain fatal unintentional injuries than
      children of wealthier, better educated parents. Studies have also found that
      children living with adults unrelated to them are at increased risk for
      unintentional injuries and maltreatment. Dysfunctional family characteristics may
      even be more indicative of child neglect. Parental alcohol or drug abuse,
      parental personal history of neglect, and parental stress greatly increase the
      odds of neglect. Parental depression doubles the odds of child neglect. However, 
      more research needs to be done to better understand these risk factors and to
      identify others. Having a clearer understanding of the risk factors could lead to
      prevention and treatment, as it would allow for health care personnel to screen
      for high-risk children and intervene before it is too late. Screening could also 
      be done in the schools and organized after school activities. Parenting classes
      have been shown to be an effective intervention strategy by decreasing parental
      stress and potential for abuse, but there has been limited research done on this 
      approach. Parenting classes can be part of the corrective actions for parents
      found to be neglectful or abusive, but parenting classes may also be useful as a 
      preventative measure, being taught in schools or readily available in higher-risk
      communities. More research has to be done to better define child abuse and
      neglect so that it can be effectively addressed and treated.

BTI - Management of Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis
AB  - Stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Although the number of
      deaths from stroke has declined in recent years, it continues to be a major
      public health problem in the United States, with an estimated $34.3 billion in
      direct cost and indirect cost of stroke in the year 2008. Carotid artery stenosis
      represents an important risk factor for ischemic stroke, which accounts for
      nearly 90 percent of all strokes among U.S. men and women. Carotid artery
      stenosis is increasingly prevalent from the fifth decade of life onward. Patients
      with vascular disease and multiple risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension,
      hyperlipidemia, and smoking) have a higher probability of having asymptomatic
      carotid stenosis. Since carotid artery atherosclerosis can largely proceed
      silently and unpredictably, the first manifestation can be a debilitating or
      fatal stroke. Asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis affects approximately 7
      percent of women and over 12 percent of men, older than 70 years of age.
      Clinically important stenosis, at which the risk of stroke is increased, is
      defined as stenosis of over 50 or 60 percent. Natural history studies have
      reported that patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis are at an increased
      risk of ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke ranging from 5 to 17
      percent. The goal of management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis is to decrease
      the risk of stroke and stroke-related deaths. However, screening asymptomatic
      patients for carotid stenosis is not part of common clinical practice as noted in
      a review by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force from 1996, which concluded
      that evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against screening. As
      the general U.S. population ages, and with the availability of noninvasive
      imaging studies, asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis may be more frequently
      detected in the course of patient management. Auscultation of the carotid
      arteries to listen for bruits is by convention an initial means of clinical
      assessment of high-risk patients, but the presence of bruits is not necessarily
      indicative of significant stenosis. Since carotid auscultation has limited
      sensitivity in detecting significant carotid stenosis, additional imaging
      modalities including digital subtraction angiography (DSA), Doppler ultrasound
      (DUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), and magnetic resonance angiography 
      (MRA) are being increasingly utilized. The most commonly used measurement method 
      of carotid stenosis used in clinical trials or most common angiographic method
      was introduced in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial
      (NASCET). In the NASCET method, the stenosis is measured as the ratio of the
      linear luminal diameter of the narrowest portion of the artery's diseased segment
      divided by the diameter of the healthy distal carotid artery (above the
      post-stenotic dilation). An alternative method was used in the European Carotid
      Surgery Trial (ECST), which utilized the estimated carotid bulb at the site of
      maximal stenosis as the denominator. The ECST method tends to yield higher
      degrees of stenosis, but measurements made by each method can be converted to
      those of the other using a simple arithmetic equation. According to the 2003
      Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound consensus criteria, a carotid stenosis is
      not quantified as an exact percentage of luminal stenosis but can be classified
      by range of stenoses that represent clinically relevant categories (normal, < 50 
      percent, 50-69 percent, >/= 70 percent but less than near occlusion, near
      occlusion, or total occlusion). Therapeutic options in asymptomatic carotid
      stenosis include medical therapy alone, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and medical 
      therapy, or carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) and medical therapy. However, 
      the optimal therapeutic management strategy for patients with asymptomatic
      carotid stenosis is unclear. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
      is interested in a systematic review of the literature on these three treatment
      strategies in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis. The Coverage and
      Analysis Group at the CMS requested the present report from the Technology
      Assessment Program (TAP) at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
      (AHRQ). AHRQ assigned this report to the Tufts Evidence-based Practice Center
      (Tufts EPC) (Contract number, HSSA 290 2007 10055 I).

TI  - The effectiveness of helplines for the treatment of alcohol and illicit substance
      use.
PG  - 18-28
LID - 10.1177/1357633X14555643 [doi]
AB  - While tobacco helplines (quitlines) are thought to be effective, helplines which 
      treat other substance use do not have an established evidence base. A review was 
      conducted of the literature on illicit drug or alcohol (IDA) helplines. The
      literature search was conducted in five databases. Studies prior to 2014 were
      included if published in English, and involved the use of a telephone counselling
      helpline for the treatment of illicit drug or alcohol use. Review papers, opinion
      pieces, letters or editorials, case studies, published abstracts and posters were
      excluded. Initial searching identified 2178 articles and after removing
      duplicates and those meeting the exclusion criteria, there were 36 publications
      for review. A total of 29 articles provided descriptive information about 19
      different IDA helplines which operated in the US (42%), Europe (21%), Australia
      (21%), Asia (11%) and Canada (5%). These services reported monthly call rates
      from 3.7 to over 23,000 calls per month. A total of nine articles provided
      evaluative information on eight different IDA helplines: four articles included a
      comparison of treatment outcomes against a control group and five articles
      included information on treatment satisfaction or service utilisation. Together
      they provide some evidence that these services are effective. Although there was 
      little consistency in the measures used between articles which assessed helpline 
      satisfaction, all but one reported high satisfaction. Although the evidence is
      mainly supportive of IDA helplines, further work is required to compare treatment
      outcomes in randomized groups.

TI  - A systematic review and meta-analysis of tobacco use and prostate cancer
      mortality and incidence in prospective cohort studies.

LID - S0302-2838(14)00812-4 [pii]
AB  - CONTEXT: An association between tobacco smoking and prostate cancer (PCa)
      incidence and mortality was suggested in an earlier meta-analysis of 24
      prospective studies in which dose-response associations and risks per unit of
      tobacco use were not examined. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between
      several measures of tobacco use and PCa mortality (primary outcome) and incidence
      (secondary outcome) including dose-response association. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:
      Relevant articles from prospective studies were identified by searching the
      PubMed and Web of Science databases (through January 21, 2014) and reference
      lists of relevant articles. Combined relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence
      intervals (CIs) were calculated using random effects methods. We also calculated 
      population attributable risk (PAR) for smoking and PCa mortality. EVIDENCE
      SYNTHESIS: We included 51 articles in this meta-analysis (11823 PCa deaths, 50349
      incident cases, and 4,082,606 cohort participants). Current cigarette smoking was
      associated with an increased risk of PCa death (RR: 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18-1.31),
      with little evidence for heterogeneity and publication bias. The number of
      cigarettes smoked per day had a dose-response association with PCa mortality
      (p=0.02; RR for 20 cigarettes per day: 1.20). The PAR for cigarette smoking and
      PCa deaths in the United States and Europe were 6.7% and 9.5%, respectively,
      corresponding to >10000 deaths/year in these two regions. Current cigarette
      smoking was inversely associated with incident PCa (RR: 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96),
      with high heterogeneity in the results. However, in studies completed in 1995 or 
      earlier (considered as completed before the prostate-specific antigen screening
      era), ever smoking showed a positive association with incident PCa (RR: 1.06; 95%
      CI, 1.00-1.12) with little heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Combined evidence from
      observational studies shows a modest but statistically significant association
      between cigarette smoking and fatal PCa. Smoking appears to be a modifiable risk 
      factor for PCa death. PATIENT SUMMARY: Smoking increases the chance of prostate
      cancer death. Not smoking prevents this harm and many other tobacco-related
      diseases.

TI  - Improving outcomes for diverse populations disproportionately affected by
      diabetes: final results of Project IMPACT: Diabetes.
PG  - 477-85
LID - 10.1331/JAPhA.2014.13240 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve key indicators of diabetes care by expanding a proven
      community-based model of care throughout high-risk areas in the United States.
      DESIGN: Observational, multisite, pre-post comparison study. SETTING: Federally
      qualified health centers, free clinics, employer worksites, community pharmacies,
      departments of health, physician offices, and other care facilities in 25
      communities in 17 states from June 2011 through January 2013. PARTICIPANTS: 1,836
      patients disproportionately affected by diabetes representing diverse
      ethnicities, insurance statuses, and social and economic backgrounds.
      INTERVENTION: Pharmacists were integrated into local, interdisciplinary diabetes 
      care teams and provided customized diabetes education and medication
      consultations to patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical measures included
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood
      pressures, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, and total cholesterol. Process measures
      included smoking status, eye examination status, foot examination status, and
      influenza vaccine status. RESULTS: Pharmacist patient care services for those
      underserved or disproportionately affected by diabetes resulted in a
      statistically significant and clinically relevant decrease in mean A1C levels
      (-0.8%). Other outcome indicators were below target levels at baseline and
      decreased significantly but not by clinically relevant amounts (LDL-C, -7.1
      mg/dL; triglycerides, -23.7 mg/dL, and total cholesterol, -8.8 mg/dL). The mean
      increase in HDL-C (+0.6 mg/dL) was not statistically significant or clinically
      relevant. Among evaluable patients who were not at target for process measures at
      baseline, 51.7% of 453 patients received eye examinations, 72.0% of 271 patients 
      received foot examinations, 41.7% of 307 patients received influenza
      vaccinations, and 9.3% patients of 270 quit smoking during the project. Of the
      communities involved in the study, 92% intend to sustain pharmacists' services.
      CONCLUSION: Project IMPACT: Diabetes results show significant improvement in
      patients' clinical outcomes and demonstrate that all patients, even those with
      tremendous barriers to appropriate diabetes care, benefit from patient-centered, 
      interdisciplinary health care teams that include pharmacists.

TI  - Gender differences in the developmental risk of onset of alcohol, nicotine, and
      marijuana use and the effects of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol outcomes.
PG  - 850-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (a) characterize gender-specific risk of onset of 
      alcohol, nicotine, and marijuana use developmentally; (b) investigate the effects
      of early-onset status and frequency of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol
      outcomes, controlling for the effects of alcohol use; and (c) examine gender
      differences in the developmental trajectories of alcohol outcomes and the effects
      of nicotine and marijuana use on alcohol outcomes. METHOD: This study conducted
      secondary analysis on a longitudinal study that recruited at-risk youth through
      fathers' drunk-driving records and door-to-door canvassing in the midwestern
      United States. The sample included 160 female-male sibling pairs who were
      assessed on substance use and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
      Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis from early childhood to young adulthood.
      RESULTS: Although males were at higher risk for being early-onset alcohol users, 
      females tended to be at higher risk for initiating marijuana use at younger ages.
      When early onset and amount of alcohol use were controlled for, early onset of
      nicotine and marijuana use did not contribute to alcohol outcomes, but
      frequencies of nicotine and marijuana use did. We also found the associations of 
      quantity/frequency of alcohol and marijuana use with drinking problems to be
      stronger among females than among males. CONCLUSIONS: Higher frequencies of
      nicotine and marijuana use may contribute to worse alcohol outcomes above and
      beyond the effect of alcohol use. Females tend to be at higher risk than males
      for initiating marijuana use and meeting an alcohol use disorder diagnosis at
      younger ages as well as being more vulnerable to a negative impact of alcohol and
      marijuana use.

TI  - Differences between attendance in emergency care of male and female victims of
      traffic accidents in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil.
PG  - 3925-30
LID - S1413-81232014000903925 [pii]
AB  - Driving under the influence of alcohol/ drugs (DUI) is a well-established risk
      factor for traffic accidents, and men and women have different consumption
      patterns. The scope of this paper is to analyze differences in alcohol and drug
      consumption, as well as on behavior associated with traffic accidents among men
      and women. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 609 sequential traffic
      accident victims attended in emergency care from Porto Alegre. Subjects gave a
      structured interview, were breathalyzed and had a saliva test for alcohol/drug
      screening. Results showed that women were mainly passengers or pedestrians (p <
      0.001). There was no significant difference in positive blood alcohol
      concentration. However, men reported more binge drinking and THC use, while women
      had more benzodiazepine in their saliva (p<0.05). This is the first Brazilian
      study to compare alcohol and drug use among men and women who were the victims of
      traffic accidents. Results point to differences in the pattern of substance
      abuse, as well on risk behavior. Data may be useful for specific prevention
      strategies that take gender differences into consideration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness of advanced technologies for diabetes management may
      differ depending on national healthcare models or population characteristics. In 
      the setting of a cross-national trial, we aimed to compare efficacy of
      sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy in the United States (US) and Canada.
      METHODS: In the clinical trial Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy for A1C Reduction
      (STAR 3), 329 adults with type 1 diabetes were randomly allocated to either SAP
      or glargine-based multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy at 26 US sites (n=271)
      and 4 Canadian sites (n=58). A bootstrap analysis was performed to confirm
      significant differences in baseline characteristics. For the primary analysis, we
      compared the baseline to 1-year change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) between
      Canadian and US subjects. RESULTS: At baseline, compared with US subjects,
      Canadian subjects were more likely to be students (19% vs. 7%, p<0.01) and to
      consume alcohol (91% vs. 63%, p<0.01). Although Canadian subjects had greater A1C
      reductions from baseline compared with US subjects (p=0.02), the incremental
      benefit of SAP was similar in the US (SAP compared with MDI, -0.93%+/-0.73% vs.
      -0.31%+/-0.81%, p<0.001) and Canada (-1.14%+/-0.72% vs. -0.67%+/-0.71%, p<0.001).
      Mean sensor use was significantly higher in Canada than in the US (79% vs. 68% of
      the time, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite differences in baseline characteristics 
      and sensor adherence, SAP efficacy was similar between US and Canadian
      participants. As long as the intervention is administered with a similar level of
      expertise as was conducted in the trial, it is likely to be applicable in diverse
      clinical practice settings.

TI  - Screening and brief intervention for drug use in primary care: the ASPIRE
      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 502-13
LID - 10.1001/jama.2014.7862 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The United States has invested substantially in screening and brief
      intervention for illicit drug use and prescription drug misuse, based in part on 
      evidence of efficacy for unhealthy alcohol use. However, it is not a recommended 
      universal preventive service in primary care because of lack of evidence of
      efficacy. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of 2 brief counseling interventions for
      unhealthy drug use (any illicit drug use or prescription drug misuse)-a brief
      negotiated interview (BNI) and an adaptation of motivational interviewing
      (MOTIV)-compared with no brief intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS:
      This 3-group randomized trial took place at an urban hospital-based primary care 
      internal medicine practice; 528 adult primary care patients with drug use
      (Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test [ASSIST]
      substance-specific scores of >/=4) were identified by screening between June 2009
      and January 2012 in Boston, Massachusetts. INTERVENTIONS: Two interventions were 
      tested: the BNI is a 10- to 15-minute structured interview conducted by health
      educators; the MOTIV is a 30- to 45-minute intervention based on motivational
      interviewing with a 20- to 30-minute booster conducted by master's-level
      counselors. All study participants received a written list of substance use
      disorder treatment and mutual help resources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary
      outcome was number of days of use in the past 30 days of the self-identified main
      drug as determined by a validated calendar method at 6 months. Secondary outcomes
      included other self-reported measures of drug use, drug use according to hair
      testing, ASSIST scores (severity), drug use consequences, unsafe sex, mutual help
      meeting attendance, and health care utilization. RESULTS: At baseline, 63% of
      participants reported their main drug was marijuana, 19% cocaine, and 17%
      opioids. At 6 months, 98% completed follow-up. Mean adjusted number of days using
      the main drug at 6 months was 12 for no brief intervention vs 11 for the BNI
      group (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.77-1.22) and 12 for the MOTIV 
      group (IRR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84-1.32; P = .81 for both comparisons vs no brief
      intervention). There were also no significant effects of BNI or MOTIV on any
      other outcome or in analyses stratified by main drug or drug use severity.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Brief intervention did not have efficacy for
      decreasing unhealthy drug use in primary care patients identified by screening.
      These results do not support widespread implementation of illicit drug use and
      prescription drug misuse screening and brief intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Environmental characteristics associated with alcohol intoxication among patrons 
      in Brazilian nightclubs.
PG  - 358-66
LID - 10.1111/dar.12155 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Few studies have investigated the association between environmental
      factors and patrons' binge drinking in nightclubs, and such studies are rare in
      developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To identify environmental factors associated
      with binge drinking among patrons in nightclubs in Sao Paulo, Brazil, using a
      mixed-methods design. METHOD: The study used a two-stage cluster sampling survey 
      design. Two levels of data were collected: observational data and portal survey
      data. Individual-level data were collected by a portal survey of 2422 subjects at
      the entrance and 1822 subjects at the exit of 31 nightclubs. Weighted multilevel 
      analysis was used to investigate the association between patrons' binge drinking 
      (as measured by breath alcohol concentration >/=0.38 mg L(-1) ) at nightclub
      exit, with environmental-level variables collected through observation and
      controlled for individual-level data. RESULTS: Pre-drinking was the variable most
      strongly associated with binge drinking BrAC levels when exiting the venue
      [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) [4.37, 8.17], P <
      0.001). The environmental variables significantly associated with binge drinking 
      were 'all you can drink' service (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI [1.03, 0.79]; P = 0.043),
      two or more dance floors (aOR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.16, 3.18]; P = 0.011), and higher
      sound levels (aOR = 1.04 per each decibel increased, 95% CI [1.01, 1.08]; P =
      0.048). Data triangulation showed an association between lower alcohol
      intoxication and ketamine use in three LGBT nightclubs. DISCUSSION: Pre-drinking 
      showed that individual-level characteristics could be more important in binge
      drinking than the venues' environmental characteristics. Previous studies failed 
      to include pre-drinking in environmental analysis. CONCLUSION: Environmental
      control interventions, isolated from individual-level approaches, may have
      limited efficacy in the prevention of alcohol abuse in nightclubs.

PG  - 1551-5
LID - 10.1111/jgs.12932 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether implementation of symptom-triggered
      administration of a benzodiazepine protocol reduces the severity (total
      cumulative dose), duration, and complications of alcohol withdrawal syndrome
      (AWS). DESIGN: Retrospective health record review. SETTING: Tertiary care center 
      in Vancouver, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 70 and older admitted to the
      Acute Care for Elders and Acute Medicine Unit wards with diagnostic codes for AWS
      from 2008 to 2012. MEASUREMENTS: Median duration and cumulative dose of
      benzodiazepine treatment, number of severe AWS complications, severe
      benzodiazepine-associated adverse effects, and need for adjunct therapy. RESULTS:
      Thirty-three participants in the preprotocol group and 30 in the
      protocol-implemented group met the inclusion criteria. Median duration of
      benzodiazepine treatment decreased from 96 hours (interquartile range (IQR)
      72-120 hours) in the preprotocol period to 48 hours (IQR 0-108 hours; P=.04), and
      median cumulative benzodiazepine dose administered decreased from 9 mg (IQR
      5-19.8 mg) to 3 mg (IQR 0-10 mg; P=.001). Statistically significantly lower
      incidence of severe AWS complications (P=.007) and adjunct therapy use (P=.02)
      was seen in the protocol-implemented group. CONCLUSION: A symptom-triggered
      protocol for dosing of benzodiazepine therapy in the management of AWS in
      individuals aged 70 and older significantly reduced the total duration of
      benzodiazepine use, cumulative benzodiazepine dose, and use of adjunctive
      medications in the treatment of AWS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate treatment adherence among perinatally-infected pediatric
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients followed in pediatric centers in
      Brazil. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional multicenter study. Medical records
      were reviewed and adherence scale, assessment of caregivers' quality of life
      (WHOQOL-BREF), anxiety, depression, and alcohol/substances use/abuse were
      assessed. Outcomes included self-reported 100% adherence in the last three days
      and HIV viral load (VL)<50 copies/mL. Statistical analyses included contingency
      tables and respective statistics, and multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS:
      260 subjects were enrolled: 78% children and 22% adolescents; 93% of caregivers
      for the children and 77% of adolescents reported 100% adherence; 57% of children 
      and 49% of adolescents had VL<50 copies/mL. In the univariate analyses, HIV
      diagnosis for screening due to maternal infection, lower caregiver scores for
      anxiety, and higher scores in physical and psychological domains of WHOQOL-BREF
      were associated with 100% adherence. Shorter intervals between pharmacy visits
      were associated with VL<50 copies/mL (p </= 0.01). Multivariable regression
      demonstrated that caregivers who did not abuse alcohol/other drugs (OR=0.49; 95% 
      CI: 0.27-0.89) and median interval between pharmacy visits<33 days (OR=0.97; 95% 
      CI: 0.95-0.98) were independently associated with VL<50 copies/mL; whereas lower 
      caregiver scores for anxiety (OR=2.57; 95% CI: 1.27-5.19) and children's HIV
      diagnosis for screening due to maternal infection (OR=2.25; 95% CI: 1.12-4.50)
      were found to be independently associated with 100% adherence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Pediatric HIV programs should perform routine assessment of caregivers' quality
      of life, and anxiety and depression symptoms. In this setting, pharmacy records
      are essential to help identify less-than-optimal adherence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study sought to examine the utility of hair testing as a
      research measure of drug use among individuals with moderate-risk drug use based 
      on the internationally validated Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement
      Screening Test (ASSIST). METHODS: This study is a secondary analysis using
      baseline data from a randomized trial of brief intervention for drug misuse, in
      which 360 adults with moderate-risk drug use were recruited from two community
      clinics in New Mexico, USA. The current study compared self-reported drug use on 
      the ASSIST with laboratory analysis of hair samples using a standard commercially
      available 5-panel test with assay screening and gas chromatography/mass
      spectrometry (GC/MS) confirmation. Both self-report and hair testing covered a
      3-month period. RESULTS: Overall concordance between hair testing and self-report
      was 57.5% (marijuana), 86.5% (cocaine), 85.8% (amphetamines), and 74.3%
      (opioids). Specificity of hair testing at standard laboratory cut-offs exceeded
      90% for all drugs, but sensitivity of hair testing relative to self-report was
      low, identifying only 52.3% (127/243) of self-disclosed marijuana users, 65.2%
      (30/46) of cocaine users, 24.2% (8/33) of amphetamine users, and 2.9% (2/68) of
      opioid users. Among participants who disclosed using marijuana or cocaine in the 
      past 3 months, participants with a negative hair test tended to report
      lower-frequency use of those drugs (p<.001 for marijuana and cocaine).
      CONCLUSIONS: Hair testing can be useful in studies with moderate-risk drug users,
      but the potential for under-identification of low-frequency use suggests that
      researchers should consider employing low detection cut-offs and using hair
      testing in conjunction with self-report.

TI  - Retreatment with varenicline for smoking cessation in smokers who have previously
      taken varenicline: a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 390-6
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2014.124 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy and safety of retreatment with varenicline in smokers attempting to 
      quit were evaluated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multicenter trial (Australia, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, France,
      Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Participants were generally 
      healthy adult smokers (>/= 10 cigarettes/day) with >/= 1 prior quit attempt (>/= 
      2 weeks) using varenicline and no quit attempts in </= 3 months; they were
      randomly assigned (1:1) to 12 weeks' varenicline (n = 251) or placebo (n = 247)
      treatment, with individual counseling, plus 40 weeks' nontreatment follow-up. The
      primary efficacy end point was the carbon monoxide-confirmed (</= 10 ppm)
      continuous abstinence rate for weeks 9-12, which was 45.0% (varenicline; n = 249)
      vs. 11.8% (placebo; n = 245; odds ratio: 7.08; 95% confidence interval: 4.34,
      11.55; P < 0.0001). Common varenicline group adverse events were nausea, abnormal
      dreams, and headache, with no reported suicidal behavior. Varenicline is
      efficacious and well tolerated in smokers who have previously taken it.
      Abstinence rates are comparable with rates reported for varenicline-naive
      smokers.

TI  - A pragmatic, randomized, controlled study evaluating the impact of access to
      smoking cessation pharmacotherapy coverage on the proportion of successful
      quitters in a Canadian population of smokers motivated to quit (ACCESSATION).
PG  - 433
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-14-433 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many smokers find the cost of smoking cessation medications a
      barrier. Financial coverage for these medications increases utilization of
      pharmacotherapies. This study assesses whether financial coverage increases the
      proportion of successful quitters. METHODS: A pragmatic, open-label, randomized, 
      controlled trial was conducted in 58 Canadian sites between March 2009 and
      September 2010. Smokers (>/=10 cigarettes/day) without insurance coverage who
      were motivated to quit within 14 days were randomized (1:1) in a blinded manner
      to receive either full coverage eligibility for 26 weeks or no coverage.
      Pharmacotherapies covered were varenicline, bupropion, or nicotine patches/gum.
      Investigators/subjects were unblinded to study group assignment after
      randomization and prior to choosing a smoking cessation method(s). All subjects
      received brief smoking cessation counseling. The primary outcome measure was
      self-reported 7-day point prevalence of abstinence (PPA) at week 26. RESULTS: Of 
      the 1380 randomized subjects (coverage, 696; no coverage, 684), 682 (98.0%) and
      435 (63.6%), respectively, were dispensed at least one smoking cessation
      medication dose. The 7-day PPA at week 26 was higher in the full coverage versus 
      no coverage group: 20.8% (n = 145) and 13.9% (n = 95), respectively; odds ratio
      (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-2.18; p = 0.001. Urine
      cotinine-confirmed 7-day PPA at week 26 was 15.7% (n = 109) and 10.1% (n = 69),
      respectively; OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.21-2.33; p = 0.002. After pharmacotherapy,
      coverage eligibility was withdrawn from the full coverage group, continuous
      abstinence between weeks 26 and 52 was 6.6% (n = 46) and 5.6% (n = 38), in the
      full coverage and no coverage groups, respectively; OR = 1.19, 95% CI 0.76-1.87; 
      p = 0.439. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the adoption of a smoking cessation
      medication coverage drug policy was an effective intervention to improve 26-week 
      quit rates in Canada. The advantages were lost once coverage was discontinued.
      Further study is required on the duration of coverage to prevent relapse to
      smoking. (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00818207; the study was sponsored by 
      Pfizer Inc.).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of COPD among patients treated in the healthcare
      system in Latin America is unknown. The PUMA study (Prevalencia y practica
      habitUal -diagnostico y tratamiento- en poblacion de riesgo de EPOC en Medicos
      generalistas de 4 paises de America Latina) screened at-risk patients attending
      primary care centers to evaluate the prevalence, diagnosis and treatment of COPD 
      in this setting. The aim of this report is to describe the study methodology.
      METHODS: Multicenter, observational, cross-sectional study conducted in
      Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela. Subjects were>/=40 years, smokers,
      former smokers and/or exposed to fossil fuels attending primary care centers.
      Eligible patients underwent pre- and post- bronchodilator spirometry and
      completed standardized questionnaires on demographics, smoking, exposure to
      environmental/domestic pollution, symptoms/history and management of respiratory 
      diseases, comorbidities, and use of healthcare resources. RESULTS: A total of 57 
      centers in 4 countries participated; 1,907 patients were included, 1,743
      completed the PUMA questionnaire and 1,540 patients underwent validated
      spirometry. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the methodology used in the PUMA study, the 
      first systematic multicenter study in four Latin American countries aimed at
      detecting COPD cases confirmed by spirometry in primary care. Approximately 90%
      of patients who completed the PUMA questionnaire underwent valid spirometry
      tests. This gives room for reflection on the feasibility of opportunistic
      screening at the primary care level to detect patients in the early stages of
      COPD or with undiagnosed COPD, and improve the diagnosis and management of this
      disease.

TI  - Demographic, risk factors and motivations among blood donors with reactive
      serologic tests for syphilis in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the demographic characteristics, risk factors and
      motivations for donating among blood donors with reactive serologic tests for
      syphilis. BACKGROUND: Post-donation interviews with syphilis seropositive blood
      donors improve recruitment and screening strategies. METHODS: This case-control
      study compares 75 Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) > 8, EIA+ (enzyme
      immunoassay) and FTA-ABS+ (fluorescent treponemal antibody); 80 VDRL-, EIA+ and
      FTA-ABS+; and 34 VDRL- and EIA- donors between 2004 and 2009. Donors were
      assessed by their demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, history of
      alcohol and illicit drugs use, and motivations to donate. RESULTS: Donors with
      VDRL > 8 were more likely to be divorced [AOR = 12.53; 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 1.30-120.81], to have had more than six sexual partners (AOR=7.1; 95% CI
      1.12-44.62) and to report male-male-sex in the past 12 months (AOR=8.18; 95% CI
      1.78-37.60). Donors with VDRL-, EIA+ and FTA-ABS+ were less likely to be female
      (AOR=0.26; 95% CI 0.07-0.96), more likely to be older (AOR=10.2; 95% CI
      2.45-42.58 >/= 39 and <60 years old) and to have had more than six sexual
      partners in the past 12 months (AOR = 8.37; 95% CI 1.49-46.91). There was no
      significant difference among groups regarding illicit drugs use; 30.7% (VDRL > 8)
      and 12.5% (VDRL-, EIA+ and FTA-ABS+) of donors reported that they had been at
      risk for HIV infection (P = 0.004). One-third of donors came to the blood bank to
      help a friend or a relative who needed blood. CONCLUSION: Although donors exposed
      to syphilis reported and recognised some high risk behaviour, most were motivated
      by direct appeal to donate blood. Monitoring the risk profile of blood donors can
      benefit public health and improve blood safety.

TI  - Clinical needs of in-treatment pregnant women with co-occurring disorders:
      implications for primary care.
PG  - 180-7
LID - 10.1007/s10995-014-1508-x [doi]
AB  - We investigated social vulnerability and behavioral health clinical profiles
      (symptom severity) of pregnant women with co-occurring disorders, defined as
      substance abuse, mental illness, and trauma at treatment entry compared to their 
      nonpregnant counterparts and the role of interpersonal abuse in clinical
      presentation among pregnant women. Our objective was to provide primary health
      care providers with insight into the needs of pregnant patients with high
      behavioral health risks to serve them better during the critical window of
      opportunity for long-term impact. We conducted cross-sectional secondary analysis
      of baseline data from women enrolled in treatment programs in the Women,
      Co-occurring Disorders and Violence Study from nine sites across the United
      States. We used analysis of variance and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistical
      analyses to compare means and frequencies of social vulnerability indicators and 
      baseline Addiction Severity Index, Brief Symptom Inventory of mental health, and 
      Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale scores between 152 pregnant and 2,577
      nonpregnant women, and between pregnant women with and without current
      interpersonal abuse. Compared to nonpregnant women, pregnant women evidenced more
      social vulnerability but better behavioral health clinical profiles at treatment 
      entry. Current interpersonal abuse was associated with increased mental health
      and trauma symptomatology but not with alcohol or drug abuse severity among
      pregnant women. The prenatal period is an important time for screening and
      intervention for factors such as social vulnerability and co-occurring disorders,
      known to affect pregnancy and infant outcomes; social and behavioral health
      services are particularly essential among pregnant women with co-occurring
      disorders.

TI  - A drug use survey among clients of harm reduction sites across British Columbia, 
      Canada, 2012.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1477-7517-11-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In British Columbia (BC), understanding of high-risk drug use trends 
      is largely based on survey and cohort study data from two major cities, which may
      not be representative of persons who use drugs in other regions. Harm reduction
      stakeholders, representing each of the five geographic health regions in BC,
      identified a need for data on drug use to inform local and regional harm
      reduction activities across the province. The aims of this project were to (1)
      develop a drug use survey that could be feasibly administered at harm reduction
      (HR) sites across all health regions and (2) assess the data for differences in
      reported drug use frequencies by region. METHODS: A pilot survey focusing on
      current drug use was developed with stakeholders and administered among clients
      at 28 HR supply distribution sites across the province by existing staff and
      peers. Data were collated and analysed using univariate and bivariate descriptive
      statistics to assess differences in reported drug use frequencies by geography. A
      post-survey evaluation was conducted to assess acceptability and feasibility of
      the survey process for participating sites. RESULTS: Crack cocaine, heroin, and
      morphine were the most frequently reported drugs with notable regional
      differences. Polysubstance use was common among respondents (70%) with one region
      having 81% polysubstance use. Respondents surveyed in or near their region's
      major centre were more likely to report having used crack cocaine (p < 0.0001)
      and heroin (p < 0.0001) in the past week as compared to those residing >50 km
      from the major centre. Participants accessing services >50 km from the regional
      centre were more likely to have used morphine (p < 0.0001). There was no
      difference in powder cocaine use by client/site proximity to the regional centre.
      Participating sites found the survey process acceptable, feasible to administer
      annually, and useful for responding to client needs. CONCLUSIONS: The survey was 
      a feasible way for harm reduction sites across BC to obtain drug use data from
      clients who actively use drugs. Drug use frequencies differed substantially by
      region and community proximity to the regional centre, underlining the need for
      locally collected data to inform service planning.

TI  - Predictors of pretreatment commitment to abstinence: results from the COMBINE
      study.
PG  - 438-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients entering treatment for alcohol problems do not have uniform
      treatment goals, and a pretreatment drinking goal has a significant impact on
      treatment outcome. The objective of this study was to understand better how an
      array of individual characteristics, including factors that affect treatment, are
      related to treatment goals before beginning alcohol treatment in the COMBINE
      (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study. METHOD: Participants 
      were alcohol-dependent individuals (N = 1,156; 357 women) recruited at 11
      outpatient academic alcoholism-treatment clinics across the United States to
      participate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that combined
      behavioral intervention with acamprosate and/or naltrexone. Treatment goal was
      coded as controlled drinking, conditional abstinence, or total abstinence.
      Multinomial logistic regressions assessed whether there were significant
      relationships between predictor variables and pretreatment goal selection.
      RESULTS: Lower levels of alcohol-related consequences, lower readiness to change,
      higher family income, more daily drinkers in social network, and lack of prior
      treatment or Alcoholics Anonymous engagement predicted choice of a controlled
      drinking goal over a total abstinence goal. Fewer alcohol-related consequences,
      lower readiness to change, and more daily drinkers in-network predicted choice of
      a conditional abstinence goal over a total abstinence goal. CONCLUSIONS: Higher
      levels of functioning, lower levels of consequences, no prior involvement in
      treatment and Alcoholics Anonymous, and a more drinking-saturated social
      environment are associated with the choice of a non-abstinence goal.

LID - S0163-8343(14)00064-4 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess correlates of hepatitis B among adults with mental illness
      under care in Brazil. METHOD: Cross-sectional national multicenter study of 2206 
      patients with mental illnesses randomly selected from 26 public mental health
      services. Sociodemographic and behavioral data were obtained from face-to-face
      interviews and psychiatric diagnoses from medical charts. Serology testing was
      conducted, and prevalence rate ratios were estimated by log-binomial regression. 
      RESULTS: The weighted prevalence rates of current hepatitis B virus (HBV)
      infection (HBsAg+) and previous HBV exposure (anti-HBc+) were 2.0% [95%
      confidence interval (CI): 1.5%-2.7%] and 17.1% (95% CI: 16.0%-19.0%),
      respectively. Correlates of HBsAg+ included male gender, younger age (18-29
      years), unstable place of residence, intellectual disability, main psychiatric
      diagnosis of dementia, presence of other medical comorbitidy, use of
      alcohol/drugs during sex, more than one sexual partner and use of cocaine.
      Correlates of anti-HBc+ included male gender, older age (>/=30 years), black skin
      color, lower education, unstable place of residence, currently hospitalized,
      intellectual disability, history of any sexually transmitted disease or syphilis,
      poor HIV knowledge, history of imprisonment and sexual violence. CONCLUSIONS:
      Hepatitis B is an important comorbidity among psychiatric patients in Brazil.
      Screening for HBV, effective prevention and intervention strategies, including
      universal HBV immunization, should be routine practices in these mental health
      services.

AB  - The study seeks to investigate factors associated with HIV infection among
      adolescents and young adults registered in the Counseling and Testing Center
      (CTC) of Feira de Santana, Bahia. An analytical study with a cross-sectional
      design was conducted using data from the CTC Information System in the period
      from 2007 to 2011. Information on 3,768 individuals were studied and the
      proportional difference was checked using the Pearson chi-squared test and
      stratified analysis by Prevalence Rate (PR) with confidence intervals of 95%,
      considering the serological status as the outcome. During the period under study,
      73 young people were infected with HIV (1.94%). In the female population,
      statistically significant associations were identified for HIV status and drug
      use and consumption of alcohol and other drugs, as well as being married or in a 
      stable relationship. In males, the consumption of other drugs and
      homosexual/bisexual orientation were associated with HIV status. In both sexes,
      in the category in a stable relationship the HIV status was associated with a
      partner using drugs and/or infected with a STD and/or HIV. These findings
      indicate the need for effective measures for the control and prevention of HIV
      infection among young people.

AB  - AIM: To study statements and recommendations on psychosocial issues as presented 
      in international evidence-based guidelines on the management of inflammatory
      bowel diseases (IBD). METHODS: MEDLINE, guidelines International Network,
      National Guideline Clearing House and National Institute for Health and Care
      Excellence were searched from January 2006 to June 30, 2013 for evidence-based
      guidelines on the management of IBD. RESULTS: The search yielded 364 hits.
      Thirteen guidelines were included in the review, of which three were prepared in 
      Asia, eight in Europe and two in the United States. Eleven guidelines made
      statements and recommendations on psychosocial issues. The guidelines were
      concordant in that mental health disorders and stress do not contribute to the
      aetiology of IBD, but that they can influence its course. It was recommended that
      IBD-patients should be screened for psychological distress. If indicated,
      psychotherapy and/or psychopharmacological therapy should be recommended.
      IBD-centres should collaborate with mental health care specialists. Tobacco
      smoking patients with Crohn's disease should be advised to quit. CONCLUSION:
      Patients and mental health specialists should be able to participate in future
      guideline groups to contribute to establishing recommendations on psychosocial
      issues in IBD. Future guidelines should acknowledge the presence of psychosocial 
      problems in IBD-patients and encourage screening for psychological distress.

TI  - Smoking behaviors among patients receiving computed tomography for lung cancer
      screening. Systematic review in support of the U.S. preventive services task
      force.
PG  - 619-27

AB  - RATIONALE: Lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is now
      widely recommended for adults who are current or former heavy smokers. It is
      important to evaluate the impact of screening on smoking abstinence rates.
      OBJECTIVE: Among current and former smokers eligible for lung cancer screening,
      we sought to determine the consequence of screening with LDCT, as well as
      subsequent results, on smoking cessation and relapse rates. EVIDENCE REVIEW: We
      searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database
      of Systematic Reviews (through the fourth quarter, 2012), MEDLINE (2000 to May
      31, 2013), reference lists of papers, and Scopus for relevant English-language
      studies and systematic reviews. To evaluate the effect of LDCT screening on
      smoking abstinence, we included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
      involving asymptomatic adults. To evaluate the association of particular results 
      and/or recommendations from a screening CT with smoking behaviors, we included
      results from RCTs as well as cohort studies. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A
      total of 8,215 abstracts were reviewed. Three publications from two European RCTs
      and five publications from three cohort studies conducted in the United States
      met inclusion criteria. The process of LDCT lung cancer screening did not
      influence smoking behaviors. LDCT recipients with results concerning for lung
      cancer had higher abstinence rates than those with scans without such findings.
      This association may have a dose-response relationship in terms of the number of 
      abnormal CT scans as well as the seriousness of the finding. CONCLUSIONS: Limited
      evidence suggests LDCT lung cancer screening itself does not influence smoking
      behaviors, but positive results are associated with increased abstinence. As lung
      cancer screening is implemented in the general population, it is very important
      to evaluate its association with smoking behaviors to maximize its potential as a
      teachable moment to encourage long-term abstinence. Clinicians should consider
      tailoring LDCT result communication to emphasize the importance of smoking
      abstinence.

TI  - Preventing smoking initiation or relapse following 8.5 weeks of involuntary
      smoking abstinence in basic military training: trial design, interventions, and
      baseline data.

AB  - Smoking cessation is a primary method of reducing excess mortality and morbidity.
      Unfortunately, the vast majority of cessation attempts end in eventual relapse.
      Relapse-prevention interventions have shown some success at improving the
      long-term maintenance of tobacco abstinence among individuals motivated to
      abstain. However, involuntary tobacco abstinence (e.g., military training,
      hospitalization, incarceration) presents another opportunity for intervention to 
      prevent relapse. During basic military training (BMT), tobacco use is strictly
      forbidden in all service branches, but tobacco relapse (and initiation) following
      BMT is extremely high. This paper reports on the design, intervention
      development, and baseline characteristics of a randomized controlled trial
      testing minimal interventions designed to prevent tobacco relapse among United
      States Air Force (USAF) personnel following BMT. Participants are randomized by
      squadron to receive either a standard smoking-cessation booklet, a new
      motivation-based booklet designed specifically for USAF personal, or the latter
      booklet combined with a brief, face-to-face motivational session. Primary
      outcomes will be self-reported tobacco use at 12 and 24month follow-up. Given
      that the Department of Defense is the world's largest employer, the potential of 
      leveraging involuntary tobacco abstinence during BMT into extended abstinence has
      substantial public health significance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the prevalence of, and associated factors
      with, anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) among HIV-positive men evaluated at
      public health services in Brazil. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a multicenter
      cross-sectional study of HIV-positive male patients attending 6 public AIDS
      referral clinics in urban Brazil. Participants were interviewed for
      sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Anal swab specimens were
      collected for anal cytology and HPV DNA testing using L1 polymerase chain
      reaction. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate risk
      factors associated with the presence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion
      (LSIL) and/or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL). RESULTS: Anal
      swabs were collected from 343 participants. Prevalence of LSIL/HSIL was 24.8%.
      The majority (60.1%) reported sexual intercourse with both men and women in their
      lifetime. At least 36.7% had 1 or more oncogenic HPV types. Four variables were
      independently associated with the presence of LSIL/HSIL in multivariate analysis:
      history of sex with both men and women (odds ratio [OR] = 4.8) or men only (OR = 
      6.2) compared with those having sex with women only; current cigarette smoking
      (OR = 2.2); current CD4(+) level between 200 and 500 cells/mm(3) (OR = 2.9) or
      below 200 cells/mm(3) (OR = 3.8) compared with CD4(+) level above 500
      cells/mm(3); and presence of oncogenic anal HPV infection (OR = 9.6).
      CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of AIN among HIV-positive men in Brazil. 
      This population may serve as an important bridge population to women with
      implications for anogenital HPV infection in both men and women. Our findings
      confirm the need to assess screening programs for AIN among high-risk groups,
      similar to those used to prevent cervical cancer.

LID - 10.1111/add.12486 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To review systematically the literature on the economic impact of smoking
      bans in bars and restaurants and provide an estimate of the impact size using
      meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies were identified by systematic database searches
      and screening references of reviews and relevant studies. Google and web-pages of
      tobacco control agencies were also searched. The review identified 56 studies
      using absolute sales, sales ratio or employment data and employing regression
      methods to evaluate the impact of smoking bans in the United States, Australia or
      in countries in South America or Europe. The meta-analysis included 39 comparable
      studies, with 129 cases identified based on the outcome measure, scope of the
      ban, type of establishment and geographical location. Methodological quality was 
      assessed based on four pre-determined criteria. Study and case selection and data
      extraction were conducted independently by two researchers. RESULTS:
      Random-effects meta-analysis of all cases showed no associations between smoking 
      bans and changes in absolute sales or employment. An increase in the share of bar
      and restaurant sector sales in total retail sales was associated with smoking
      bans [0.23 percentage-points; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.08-0.375]. When
      cases were separated by business type (bars or restaurants or wider hospitality
      including bars and restaurants), some differential impacts emerged. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Meta-analysis of the economic impact of smoking bans in hospitality sector showed
      overall no substantial economic gains or losses. Differential impacts were
      observed across individual business types and outcome variable, but at aggregate 
      level these appear to balance out.

AB  - BACKGROUND: For more than two decades, integration of team-based approaches in
      primary care, including physicians, advanced practice registered nurses and
      physician assistants (APRN/PA), have been recommended for improving healthcare
      delivery, yet little is known about their roles in cancer screening and
      prevention. This study aims to review the current literature on the participation
      and roles of APRN/PAs in providing cancer screening and prevention
      recommendations in primary care settings in the United States. METHODS: We
      searched MEDLINE and CINAHL to identify studies published in 1990-2011 reporting 
      on cervical, breast, and colorectal cancer screening and smoking cessation, diet,
      and physical activity recommendations by APRN/PAs in the United States. A total
      of 15 studies met all of our eligibility criteria. Key study, provider, and
      patient characteristics were abstracted as were findings about APRN/PA
      recommendations for screening and prevention. RESULTS: Most studies were
      cross-sectional, showed results from within a single city or state, had
      relatively small sample sizes, reported non-standardized outcome measures. Few
      studies reported any patient characteristics. APRN/PAs are involved in
      recommending cancer screening and prevention, although we found variation across 
      screening tests and health behavior recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Additional
      research on the cancer prevention and screening practices of APRN/PAs in primary 
      care settings using standardized outcome measures in relation to evidence-based
      guidelines may help strengthen primary care delivery in the United States.

TI  - Computerized versus in-person brief intervention for drug misuse: a randomized
      clinical trial.
PG  - 1091-8
LID - 10.1111/add.12502 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have found that brief interventions (BIs)
      for drug misuse have superior effectiveness to no-treatment controls. However,
      many health centers do not provide BIs for drug use consistently due to
      insufficient behavioral health staff capacity. Computerized BIs for drug use are 
      a promising approach, but their effectiveness compared with in-person BIs has not
      been established. This study compared the effectiveness of a computerized brief
      intervention (CBI) to an in-person brief intervention (IBI) delivered by a
      behavioral health counselor. METHODS: Two-arm randomized clinical trial,
      conducted in two health centers in New Mexico, United States. Participants were
      360 adult primary care patients with moderate-risk drug scores on the Alcohol,
      Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) who were randomly
      assigned on a 1 : 1 basis to a computerized brief intervention (CBI) or to an
      in-person brief intervention (IBI) delivered by a behavioral health counselor.
      Assessments were conducted at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and included the
      ASSIST and drug testing on hair samples. RESULTS: The IBI and CBI conditions did 
      not differ at 3 months on global ASSIST drug scores [b = -1.79; 95% confidence
      interval (CI) = -4.37, 0.80] or drug-positive hair tests [odds ratio (OR) = 0.97;
      95% CI = 0.47, 2.02]. There was a statistically significant advantage of CBI over
      IBI in substance-specific ASSIST scores for marijuana (b = -1.73; 95% CI = -2.91,
      -0.55; Cohen's d = 0.26; P = 0.004) and cocaine (b = -4.48; 95% CI = -8.26,
      -0.71; Cohen's d = 0.50; P = 0.021) at 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized brief 
      intervention can be an effective alternative to in-person brief intervention for 
      addressing moderate drug use in primary care.

TI  - Yo Puedo--a conditional cash transfer and life skills intervention to promote
      adolescent sexual health: results of a randomized feasibility study in san

AB  - PURPOSE: We designed and evaluated for feasibility an intervention-Yo Puedo-that 
      addresses social network influences and socioeconomic opportunities in a
      neighborhood with substantial gang exposure and early childbearing. METHODS: Yo
      Puedo combined conditional cash transfers for completion of educational and
      reproductive health wellness goals with life skills sessions, and targeted youth 
      16-21 years of age and same-aged members of their social network. We conducted a 
      two-arm study with social networks randomized to the intervention or a standard
      services control arm. We evaluated intervention uptake, adherence, and safety;
      and assessed evidence of effects on behavioral outcomes associated with
      unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection risk. RESULTS: A total of
      72 social networks composed of 162 youth enrolled, with 92% retention over 6
      months. Seventy-two percent of youth randomized to the intervention participated 
      in intervention activities: 53% received at least one conditional cash transfer
      payment and 66% came to at least one life skills session. We found no evidence
      that cash payments financed illicit or high-risk behavior. At 6 months, compared 
      with controls, intervention participants had a lower odds of hanging out on the
      street frequently (odds ratio [OR], .54; p = .10) and a lower odds of reporting
      that their close friends had been incarcerated (OR, .6; p = .12). They reported
      less regular alcohol use (OR, .54; p = .04) and a lower odds of having sex (OR,
      .50; p = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility evaluation of Yo Puedo demonstrated
      its promise; a larger evaluation of effects on pregnancy and sustained behavioral
      changes is warranted.

TI  - Phone-delivered brief motivational interventions for mandated college students
      delivered during the summer months.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Across the United States, tens of thousands of college students are
      mandated to receive an alcohol intervention following an alcohol policy
      violation. Telephone interventions may be an efficient method to provide mandated
      students with an intervention, especially when they are away from campus during
      summer vacation. However, little is known about the utility of
      telephone-delivered brief motivational interventions. METHOD: Participants in the
      study (N=57) were college students mandated to attend an alcohol program
      following a campus-based alcohol citation. Participants were randomized to a
      brief motivational phone intervention (pBMI) (n=36) or assessment only (n=21).
      Ten participants (27.8%) randomized to the pBMI did not complete the
      intervention. Follow-up assessments were conducted 3, 6, and 9 months
      post-intervention. RESULTS: Results indicated the pBMI significantly reduced the 
      number of alcohol-related problems compared to the assessment-only group.
      Participants who did not complete the pBMI appeared to be lighter drinkers at
      baseline and randomization, suggesting the presence of alternate influences on
      alcohol-related problems. CONCLUSION: Phone BMIs may be an efficient and
      cost-effective method to reduce harms associated with alcohol use by
      heavy-drinking mandated students during the summer months.

TI  - Trends of cervical cancer in Greenland: a 60-year overview.
PG  - 452-61
LID - 10.3109/0284186X.2014.883462 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to its extraordinarily fast economic and social transition,
      virtually closed borders before 1940 and, moreover, that 85% of the population
      has the distinctive genetics of the Inuit, Greenland is a very interesting
      country to study cervical cancer from a historical perspective. Nevertheless,
      little has been reported about long-term cancer trends in Greenland. Our aim was 
      to describe and interpret the incidence of cervical cancer from 1950 to 2009.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed for articles reporting
      the incidence of cervical cancer in Greenland. We supplemented this with data for
      1980-2009 obtained from the Chief Medical Officer of Greenland. RESULTS:
      Incidence of cervical cancer was around 10 per 100 000 women (age-standardised,
      world population, ASW) in the 1950s, 30 per 100 000 in the 1960s, and in the
      1980s around 60 per 100 000. From 1985 onwards, the incidence of cervical cancer 
      started decreasing to the current level of 25 per 100 000. CONCLUSION: The steep 
      increase in the incidence of cervical cancer from the 1950s onwards is unlikely
      to be explained by increasing completeness of data. In parallel with the economic
      development, however, out-of-wedlock births (proxy for sexual behaviour)
      increased dramatically from 1935 onwards while tobacco use increased from the
      1950s onwards. From the late 1960s to around 1990, data suggested rather stable
      but high levels of sexual habits. The decrease in the incidence of cervical
      cancer since 1985 is consistent with the introduction of screening. The data
      strongly suggested that the increased burden of cervical cancer in Greenlandic
      women was real and followed earlier changes in sexual behaviour; these changes
      were likely a consequence of the tremendous societal changes.

TI  - Effect of nicotine replacement therapy on quitting by young adults in a trial
      comparing cessation services.
PG  - E7-E15
LID - 10.1097/PHH.0b013e3182a0b8c7 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Young adult smokers have the highest smoking prevalence among all US age
      groups but are least likely to use evidence-based cessation counseling or
      medication to quit. OBJECTIVE: Use and effectiveness of nicotine patch were
      explored in a randomized trial evaluating smoking cessation interventions with
      this population. PARTICIPANTS: Smokers aged 18 to 30 (n = 3094) were recruited
      through online and off-line methods and from telephone quit lines and analyzed.
      DESIGN: Smokers were enrolled in a pretest-posttest trial, and randomized to 1 of
      3 cessation services. SETTING: Trial delivering counseling services by self-help 
      booklet, telephone quit lines, or online expert system in the 48 continental
      United States. INTERVENTION: Smokers could request a free 2-week course of
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches from the project. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURE: Follow-up surveys at 12 and 26 weeks assessed smoking abstinence, use of
      NRT, counseling, and other cessation medications, and smoking-related variables. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 69.0% of smokers reported using NRT (M = 3.2 weeks) at 12 weeks
      and 74.8% (M = 3.3 weeks) at 26 weeks. More smokers who were sent the free
      nicotine patches (n = 1695; 54.8%) reported using NRT than those who did not
      receive them (12 weeks: 84.3% vs 41.9%, P < .001; 26 weeks: 87.6% vs 51.1%, P <
      .001). The use of NRT was associated with greater smoking abstinence at 12 weeks 
      (P < .001) and 26 weeks (P < .05), especially if used for more than 2 weeks (P < 
      .001). Smokers assigned to a self-help booklet or cessation Web site and heavier 
      smokers were most likely to use NRT (P < .05), whereas those reporting marijuana 
      use and binge drinking used NRT less (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Many young adults
      were willing to try NRT, and it appeared to help them quit in the context of
      community-based cessation services. Strategies should be developed to make NRT
      available to this age group and support them in using it to prevent lifelong
      smoking.

TI  - Disseminating alcohol screening and brief intervention at trauma centers: a
      policy-relevant cluster randomized effectiveness trial.
PG  - 754-65
LID - 10.1111/add.12492 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In 2005 the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate
      requiring that level I trauma centers have mechanisms to identify and intervene
      with problem drinkers. The aim of this investigation was to determine if a
      multi-level trauma center intervention targeting both providers and patients
      would lead to higher-quality alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) when 
      compared with trauma center mandate compliance without implementation
      enhancements. DESIGN: Cluster randomized trial in which intervention site (site n
      = 10, patient n = 409) providers received 1-day workshop training on
      evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) alcohol interventions and four
      30-minute feedback and coaching sessions; control sites (site n = 10, patient n =
      469) implemented the mandate without study team training enhancements. SETTING:
      Trauma centers in the United States of America. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 878
      blood alcohol-positive in-patients with and without traumatic brain injury (TBI).
      MEASUREMENTS: MI skills of providers were assessed with fidelity coded
      standardized patient interviews. All patients were interviewed at baseline and 6-
      and 12-months post-injury with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
      (AUDIT). FINDINGS: Intervention site providers consistently demonstrated enhanced
      MI skills compared with control providers. Intervention patients demonstrated an 
      8% reduction in AUDIT hazardous drinking relative to controls over the course of 
      the year after injury (relative risk = 0.88, 95%, confidence interval = 0.79,
      0.98). Intervention patients were more likely to demonstrate improvements in
      alcohol use problems in the absence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (P = 0.002). 
      CONCLUSION: Trauma center providers can be trained to deliver higher-quality
      alcohol screening and brief intervention (SBI) than untrained providers, which is
      associated with modest reductions in alcohol use problems, particularly among
      patients without TBI.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial testing the efficacy of a brief cannabis universal 
      prevention program among adolescents in primary care.
PG  - 786-97
LID - 10.1111/add.12469 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To examine the efficacy of a brief intervention delivered by a therapist
      (TBI) or a computer (CBI) in preventing cannabis use among adolescents in urban
      primary care clinics. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial comparing: CBI and
      TBI versus control. SETTING: Urban primary care clinics in the United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: Research staff recruited 714 adolescents (aged 12-18 years) who
      reported no life-time cannabis use on a screening survey for this study, which
      included a baseline survey, randomization (stratified by gender and grade) to
      conditions (control; CBI; TBI) and 3-, 6- and 12-month assessments. MEASUREMENTS:
      Using an intent-to-treat approach, primary outcomes were cannabis use (any,
      frequency); secondary outcomes included frequency of other drug use, severity of 
      alcohol use and frequency of delinquency (among 85% completing follow-ups).
      FINDINGS: Compared with controls, CBI participants had significantly lower rates 
      of any cannabis use over 12 months (24.16%, 16.82%, respectively, P < 0.05),
      frequency of cannabis use at 3 and 6 months (P < 0.05) and other drug use at 3
      months (P < 0.01). Compared with controls, TBI participants did not differ in
      cannabis use or frequency, but had significantly less other drug use at 3 months 
      (P < 0.05), alcohol use at 6 months (P < 0.01) and delinquency at 3 months (P <
      0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Among adolescents in urban primary care in the United States,
      a computer brief intervention appeared to prevent and reduce cannabis use. Both
      computer and therapist delivered brief interventions appeared to have small
      effects in reducing other risk behaviors, but these dissipated over time.

TI  - Sexual concerns of cardiac patients: predictors and the influence of specific
      sexual activities.
PG  - 45-52
LID - 10.1177/1474515113517782 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Addressing sexual concerns of cardiac patients is integral to
      comprehensive patient-centered nursing care, and instruments for use across
      cardiac populations are needed to promote this activity. Knowing the factors that
      contribute to sexual concerns provides insights that help to promote inclusion of
      assessment of relevant sexual activity and provide sexual counseling as a
      standard of care. AIM: This study examined demographic factors, comorbid
      conditions, and sexual activities as predictive of sexual concerns. Specific
      sexual activities and demographic variables were also examined for their relation
      to sexual concerns. METHODS: This study was a sub-analysis of a cross-sectional
      observational study testing a regression model of factors that predicted sexual
      concerns in a broad sample of cardiac patients in the United States, using a
      self-report survey method. RESULTS: More comorbidities and types of sexual
      activities contributed to greater sexual concerns reported by respondents. Sexual
      activities resulting in overall sexual concerns included hugging/kissing, oral
      sex, and finger penetration. Non-Whites reported more sexual concerns, sexual
      fears, and symptoms related to sexual activity. Those who were not
      working/retired from employment reported significantly more sexual concerns and
      dysfunction, whereas, those who had a smoking/tobacco use history reported more
      sexual concerns, symptoms, and dysfunction. CONCLUSION: This study underscores
      that cardiac patients across a variety of diagnoses and comorbidities often
      experience sexual concerns, fears, symptoms, and dysfunction. The strongest
      predictors of sexual concerns were the number of cardiac and noncardiac
      comorbidities, thus illustrating the importance of a thorough assessment of these
      factors when examining sexual concerns of cardiac patients.

AB  - In 2011 and 2012, 147 patients in urban United States Community Health Centers
      who misused drugs, but did not meet criteria for drug dependence, received a
      brief intervention as part of a National Institute on Drug Abuse-funded clinical 
      trial of a screening and brief intervention protocol. Potential study
      participants were identified using the World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol,
      Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Data gathered during brief
      interventions were analyzed using grounded theory strategies to identify barriers
      patients believed inhibited drug use behavior change. Numerous perceived barriers
      to drug use behavior change were identified. Study implications and limitations
      are discussed.

TI  - Cost of speech-language interventions for children and youth with foetal alcohol 
      spectrum disorder in Canada.
PG  - 571-81
LID - 10.3109/17549507.2013.862858 [doi]
AB  - This study, which is part of a large economic project on the overall burden and
      cost associated with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in Canada, estimated
      the cost of 1:1 speech-language interventions among children and youth with FASD 
      for Canada in 2011. The number of children and youth with FASD and
      speech-language disorder(s) (SLD), the distribution of the level of severity, and
      the number of hours needed to treat were estimated using data from the available 
      literature. 1:1 speech-language interventions were computed using the average
      cost per hour for speech-language pathologists. It was estimated that 37,928
      children and youth with FASD had SLD in Canada in 2011. Using the most
      conservative approach, the annual cost of 1:1 speech-language interventions among
      children and youth with FASD is substantial, ranging from $72.5 million to $144.1
      million Canadian dollars. Speech-language pathologists should be aware of the
      disproportionate number of children and youth with FASD who have SLD and the need
      for early identification to improve access to early intervention. Early
      identification and access to high quality services may have a role in decreasing 
      the risk of developing the secondary disabilities and in reducing the economic
      burden of FASD on society.

      pre-diagnostic blood DNA among US (PLCO) and European (ATBC) cohort study
      participants.

AB  - Global methylation in blood DNA has been associated with bladder cancer risk in
      case-control studies, but has not been examined prospectively. We examined the
      association between LINE1 total percent 5-methylcytosine and bladder cancer risk 
      using pre-diagnostic blood DNA from the United States-based, Prostate, Lung,
      Colorectal, Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) (299 cases/676 controls), and
      the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) cohort of Finnish
      male smokers (391 cases/778 controls). Logistic regression adjusted for age at
      blood draw, study center, pack-years of smoking, and sex was used to estimate odd
      ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using study- and sex-specific
      methylation quartiles. In PLCO, higher, although non-significant, bladder cancer 
      risks were observed for participants in the highest three quartiles (Q2-Q4)
      compared with the lowest quartile (Q1) (OR = 1.36, 95% CI: 0.96 -1.92). The
      association was stronger in males (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.00-2.20) and
      statistically significant among male smokers (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1 OR = 1.83, 95% CI:
      1.14-2.95). No association was found among females or female smokers. Findings
      for male smokers were validated in ATBC (Q2-Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 2.31, 95% CI:
      1.62-3.30) and a highly significant trend was observed (P = 8.7 x 10(-7)). After 
      determining that study data could be combined, pooled analysis of PLCO and ATBC
      male smokers (580 cases/1119 controls), ORs were significantly higher in Q2-Q4
      compared with Q1 (OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.52-2.72), and a trend across quartiles was
      observed (P = 0.0001). These findings suggest that higher global methylation
      levels prior to diagnosis may increase bladder cancer risk, particularly among
      male smokers.

TI  - Factors influencing the decline in stroke mortality: a statement from the
      American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.
PG  - 315-53
LID - 10.1161/01.str.0000437068.30550.cf [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke mortality has been declining since the early 20th 
      century. The reasons for this are not completely understood, although the decline
      is welcome. As a result of recent striking and more accelerated decreases in
      stroke mortality, stroke has fallen from the third to the fourth leading cause of
      death in the United States. This has prompted a detailed assessment of the
      factors associated with the change in stroke risk and mortality. This statement
      considers the evidence for factors that have contributed to the decline and how
      they can be used in the design of future interventions for this major public
      health burden. METHODS: Writing group members were nominated by the committee
      chair and co-chair on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas
      and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council's Scientific
      Statements Oversight Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript
      Oversight Committee. The writers used systematic literature reviews, references
      to published clinical and epidemiological studies, morbidity and mortality
      reports, clinical and public health guidelines, authoritative statements,
      personal files, and expert opinion to summarize evidence and to indicate gaps in 
      current knowledge. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to
      comment on this document and approved the final version. The document underwent
      extensive American Heart Association internal peer review, Stroke Council
      leadership review, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee review before
      consideration and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and
      Coordinating Committee. RESULTS: The decline in stroke mortality over the past
      decades represents a major improvement in population health and is observed for
      both sexes and for all racial/ethnic and age groups. In addition to the overall
      impact on fewer lives lost to stroke, the major decline in stroke mortality seen 
      among people <65 years of age represents a reduction in years of potential life
      lost. The decline in mortality results from reduced incidence of stroke and lower
      case-fatality rates. These significant improvements in stroke outcomes are
      concurrent with cardiovascular risk factor control interventions. Although it is 
      difficult to calculate specific attributable risk estimates, efforts in
      hypertension control initiated in the 1970s appear to have had the most
      substantial influence on the accelerated decline in stroke mortality. Although
      implemented later, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia control and smoking
      cessation programs, particularly in combination with treatment of hypertension,
      also appear to have contributed to the decline in stroke mortality. The potential
      effects of telemedicine and stroke systems of care appear to be strong but have
      not been in place long enough to indicate their influence on the decline. Other
      factors had probable effects, but additional studies are needed to determine
      their contributions. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in stroke mortality is real and
      represents a major public health and clinical medicine success story. The
      repositioning of stroke from third to fourth leading cause of death is the result
      of true mortality decline and not an increase in mortality from chronic lung
      disease, which is now the third leading cause of death in the United States.
      There is strong evidence that the decline can be attributed to a combination of
      interventions and programs based on scientific findings and implemented with the 
      purpose of reducing stroke risks, the most likely being improved control of
      hypertension. Thus, research studies and the application of their findings in
      developing intervention programs have improved the health of the population. The 
      continued application of aggressive evidence-based public health programs and
      clinical interventions is expected to result in further declines in stroke
      mortality.

TI  - Impact of a web-based intervention supplemented with text messages to improve
      cancer prevention behaviors among adolescents: results from a randomized

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of a web-based intervention supplemented with
      text messages to reduce cancer risk linked with smoking, unhealthy diet, alcohol 
      consumption, obesity, sedentary lifestyle and sun exposure. METHODS: A total of
      2001 voluntary adolescents from Spain and Mexico were recruited between 2009 and 
      2012 and randomly assigned to: one control group and two experimental groups,
      which received exclusively the online intervention (experimental group 1) or the 
      intervention supplemented with encouraging text messages (experimental group 2). 
      The educational intervention was based on both: successful psychosocial models
      (i.e. A.S.E. and Transtheoretical model) and the school curriculum. RESULTS:
      After a 9-month follow-up, the prevalence of students who did not eat fruit was
      reduced significantly in all groups: experimental group 1 (-62.6%), experimental 
      group 2 (-71.5%) and even the control group (-66.8%). Being overweight was only
      reduced in the experimental group 2 (-19.6%). The total cancer behavioral risk
      score, which ranged from 0 to 100 points (highest risk), was significantly
      reduced in the experimental group 1 (-3.5 points) and in the experimental group 2
      (-5.3 points). The text-supplemented online intervention increased the
      probability of improving the post-test total cancer behavioral risk (OR=1.62).
      CONCLUSION: The web-based intervention supplemented with text messages had a
      positive global impact, but it lead to only minimal changes in risky behaviors.
      This intervention appears useful in controlling overweight adolescents. CLINICAL 
      TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN27988779.

TI  - Topical ivermectin 0.5% lotion for treatment of head lice.
PG  - 1161-7
LID - 10.1177/1060028013500645 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse
      effects, and place in therapy of a single application of topical ivermectin 0.5% 
      lotion for head lice treatment. DATA SOURCES: Literature was obtained by
      searching MEDLINE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus (January 1980 to January 2013).
      Abstracts were searched for the terms ivermectin AND (head lice or pediculus or
      pediculosis), topical ivermectin, ivermectin lotion, ivermectin AND (pharmacology
      OR pharmacokinetics). The New Drug Application filed with the Food and Drug
      Administration and the product data sheets for ivermectin were obtained. STUDY
      SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles retrieved from the
      search were evaluated for relevance to the objective. DATA SYNTHESIS: The
      recommended first-line head lice treatments in the United States are permethrin
      1% or pyrethrins, with malathion 0.5% lotion used as a second-line treatment.
      Significantly more of the 289 head lice-infested participants using topical
      ivermectin 0.5% lotion were lice-free at day 15 when compared with vehicle
      control (73.8% vs 17.6%; P < .001) in 2 studies. Although this rate is lower than
      other third-line treatments (eg, spinosad 0.9% or benzyl alcohol 5%), topical
      ivermectin 0.5% lotion is well tolerated (pruritus, the most common adverse
      event, 0.9%) and requires only a single application. CONCLUSIONS: Topical
      ivermectin 0.5% lotion kills head lice by increasing chloride in muscle cells,
      causing hyperpolarization and paralysis. Only 1 application is required; when the
      treated eggs hatch, the lice are not viable because they cannot feed as a result 
      of pharyngeal muscle paralysis. Minimal systemic absorption occurs following
      topical application. Studies have demonstrated that topical ivermectin 0.5% is a 
      safe and efficacious treatment for head lice. Although it has no documented
      resistance, there is limited clinical experience, it requires a prescription, and
      it is expensive. Therefore it should be reserved as a third-line treatment for
      head lice in the United States.

TI  - Tobacco cessation among low-income smokers: motivational enhancement and nicotine
      patch treatment.
PG  - 413-22
LID - 10.1093/ntr/ntt166 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite decades of tobacco use decline among the general population
      in the United States, tobacco use among low-income populations continues to be a 
      major public health concern. Smoking rates are higher among individuals with less
      than a high school education, those with no health insurance, and among
      individuals living below the federal poverty level. Despite these disparities,
      smoking cessation treatments for low-income populations have not been extensively
      tested. In the current study, the efficacy of 2 adjunctive smoking cessation
      interventions was evaluated among low-income smokers who were seen in a primary
      care setting. METHODS: A total of 846 participants were randomly assigned either 
      to motivational enhancement treatment plus brief physician advice and 8 weeks of 
      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or to standard care, which consisted of brief 
      physician advice and 8 weeks of NRT. Tobacco smoking abstinence was at 1, 2, 6,
      and 12 months following baseline. RESULTS: The use of the nicotine patch,
      telephone counseling, and positive decisional balance were predictive of
      increased abstinence rates, and elevated stress levels and temptation to smoke in
      both social/habit and negative affect situations decreased abstinence rates
      across time. Analyses showed intervention effects on smoking temptations, length 
      of patch use, and number of telephone contacts. Direct intervention effects on
      abstinence rates were not significant, after adjusting for model predictors and
      selection bias due to perirandomization attrition. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating
      therapeutic approaches that promote use of and adherence to medications for
      quitting smoking and that target stress management and reducing negative affect
      may enhance smoking cessation among low-income smokers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brief Motivational Intervention (BMI) is an effective treatment
      for alcohol misuse but has not been adequately tested for use in helplines for
      alcoholics. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a
      telephone-based BMI for Brazilians seeking help with alcohol use cessation.
      METHODS: A randomized, controlled trial was performed with Brazilian subjects.
      Participants were randomly assigned to either the minimal intervention group
      (i.e., given reference materials) or the BMI group. Alcohol abstinence was
      evaluated in a 6-month follow-up telephone counseling session. The analysis was
      based on the intention to treat (ITT). RESULTS: Of the 5,896 drug users who
      called the helpline, 700 (12%) used alcohol, 637 of whom enrolled in this study. 
      At 6-month follow-up, 70% of the BMI group had stopped consuming alcohol compared
      to 41% in the control group (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-1.9;
      p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A helpline-based BMI helps alcohol users achieve
      abstinence.

AB  - Herein, we review a translational development plan to advance allopregnanolone to
      the clinic as a regenerative therapeutic for neurodegenerative diseases, in
      particular Alzheimer's. Allopregnanolone, an endogenous neurosteroid that
      declines with age and neurodegenerative disease, was exogenously administered and
      assessed for safety and efficacy to promote neuro-regeneration, cognitive
      function and reduction of Alzheimer's pathology. Allopregnanolone-induced
      neurogenesis correlated with restoration of learning and memory function in a
      mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and was comparably efficacious in aged normal 
      mice. Critical to success was a dosing and treatment regimen that was consistent 
      with the temporal requirements of systems biology of regeneration in brain. A
      treatment regimen that adhered to regenerative requirements of brain was also
      efficacious in reducing Alzheimer's pathology. With an optimized dosing and
      treatment regimen, chronic allopregnanolone administration promoted neurogenesis,
      oligodendrogenesis, reduced neuroinflammation and beta-amyloid burden while
      increasing markers of white matter generation and cholesterol homeostasis.
      Allopregnanolone meets three of the four drug-like physicochemical properties
      described by Lipinski's rule that predict the success rate of drugs in
      development for clinical trials. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes,
      securing GMP material, development of clinically translatable formulations and
      acquiring regulatory approval are discussed. Investigation of allopregnanolone as
      a regenerative therapeutic has provided key insights into mechanistic targets for
      neurogenesis and disease modification, dosing requirements, optimal treatment
      regimen, route of administration and the appropriate formulation necessary to
      advance to proof of concept clinical studies to determine efficacy of
      allopregnanolone as a regenerative and disease modifying therapeutic for
      Alzheimer's disease.

      Services Task Force Recommendation
AB  - Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.
      However, persons with early lung cancer have lower lung cancer-related mortality 
      than those with extensive disease, suggesting early detection and treatment of
      lung cancer might be beneficial. Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and chest
      x-ray (CXR) have been studied for early screening, with several new studies
      reporting results since the last review. To update the 2004 review of screening
      for lung cancer for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. MEDLINE (2000 to
      2012), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of
      Systematic Reviews (through fourth quarter 2012), Scopus, and reference lists.
      English-language randomized, controlled trials or cohort studies that evaluated
      screening or treatment interventions for lung cancer and reported health
      outcomes. Details about participants, study design, analysis, followup, and
      results were abstracted; study quality was rated using established criteria,
      where applicable. Four trials reported the effectiveness of screening with LDCT
      for lung cancer in patients with personal smoking exposure: one large
      good-quality trial reported screening was associated with reduced lung cancer and
      all-cause mortality reductions of 20 percent (95% CI, 6.8 to 27.6) and 6.7
      percent (95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6), respectively. Three small European trials (two
      fair- and one poor-quality) showed no benefit of screening. When the three good- 
      or fair-quality trials were combined in random effects meta-analysis, the
      relative risk of lung cancer mortality was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.91). One trial
      evaluated CXR screening in over 150,000 participants from the general population 
      and reported no benefit of screening in this group or in a subset with personal
      tobacco smoke exposure. The reported sensitivity of LDCT for detecting lung
      cancer ranged from 80 to 100 percent and specificity from 28 to 100 percent in
      six studies; each study varied in its reporting method. The harms associated with
      LDCT screening included radiation exposure ranging from 0.61 to 1.5 mSv per scan,
      some degree of overdiagnosis of lung cancer that varied by study, and a high rate
      of false-positive examinations, which were typically resolved with further
      imaging. Most patients with positive results who underwent an invasive procedure 
      were diagnosed with lung cancer. Smoking cessation was not significantly impacted
      by screening, although individuals with positive or indeterminate screens showed 
      a trend toward reduced smoking or sustained abstinence. Patients with positive or
      indeterminate scans had some evidence of short-term increases in anxiety and
      distress but not long-term in the five studies evaluating this; patients with
      negative scans had a reduction in distress. Finally, no trials comparing
      treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with no treatment have
      been conducted. However, survival associated with surgical resection was
      evaluated in 11 studies of mostly symptomatic and unselected patients that have
      shown 5-year survival rates in the 71 to 90 percent range for stage IA NSCLC and 
      42 to 75 percent for stage IB NSCLC and that surgical resection is the U.S.
      standard of care. Harms of treatment of stage I NSCLC were poorly reported and
      ranged among the studies that reported them. Three trials were underpowered and
      of too short of duration to reach conclusions on effectiveness of screening.
      Overdiagnosis is an important harm of screening but its magnitude is uncertain.
      No studies of LDCT have reported results in women or minority populations. Good
      evidence shows LDCT can significantly reduce mortality from lung cancer. However,
      there are significant harms associated with screening that must be balanced with 
      the benefits. More efforts to reduce false-positive examinations are of paramount
      importance and smoking cessation remains the most important approach to reducing 
      lung cancer mortality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alcohol has been found to increase tobacco smoking in both
      dependent daily smokers (DDS) and nondependent nondaily smokers (NNS), yet little
      attention has been directed toward examining how different treatments/products
      modify drinking-related smoking behavior. METHODS: This study examined the acute 
      effects of snus (4mg of nicotine) on alcohol-related smoking responses in 18 DDS 
      and 17 NNS. During each double-blind session, participants were randomly assigned
      to receive one of the following combinations: alcohol and snus, alcohol and
      placebo snus, placebo alcohol and snus, or placebo alcohol and placebo snus.
      Participants consumed their assigned beverage before absorbing their session's
      product, and after 30min participants could self-administer puffs of their
      preferred brand of cigarette over a 60-minute period using a progressive ratio
      task. RESULTS: Alcohol significantly increased tobacco craving (p<.001) and
      tended to decrease latency to start smoking (p=.021) but only among NNS. In
      contrast, snus tended to decrease the number of puffs earned and how hard DDS
      worked for puffs in both beverage conditions (ps</=.019) but it did not alter the
      smoking behavior of NNS. Craving was not significantly impacted by snus in either
      type of smoker. DISCUSSION: These findings raise the possibility that different
      processes mediate alcohol and cigarette co-use in NNS and DDS and suggest that
      snus may be effective in reducing alcohol-related cigarette use in DDS
      specifically.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Among illegal psycho-active drugs, cannabis is the most consumed by
      French adolescents. Multidimensional family therapy (MDFT) is a family-based
      outpatient therapy which has been developed for adolescents with drug and
      behavioral problems. MDFT has shown its effectiveness in adolescents with
      substance abuse disorders (notably cannabis abuse) not only in the United States 
      but also in Europe (International Cannabis Need of Treatment project). MDFT is a 
      multidisciplinary approach and an evidence-based treatment, at the crossroads of 
      developmental psychology, ecological theories and family therapy. Its
      psychotherapeutic techniques find its roots in a variety of approaches which
      include systemic family therapy and cognitive therapy. OBJECTIVE: The aims of
      this paper are: to describe all the backgrounds of MDFT by highlighting its
      characteristics; to explain how structural and strategy therapies have influenced
      this approach; to explore the links between MDFT, brief strategic family therapy 
      and multi systemic family therapy; and to underline the specificities of this
      family therapy method. DISCUSSION: The multidimensional family therapy was
      created on the bases of 1) the integration of multiple therapeutic techniques
      stemming from various family therapy theories; and 2) studies which have shown
      family therapy efficiency. Several trials have shown a better efficiency of MDFT 
      compared to group treatment, cognitive-behavioral therapy and home-based
      treatment. Studies have also highlighted that MDFT led to superior treatment
      outcomes, especially among young people with severe drug use and psychiatric
      co-morbidities. In the field of systemic family therapies, MDFT was influenced
      by: 1) the structural family therapy (S. Minuchin), 2) the strategic family
      theory (J. Haley), and 3) the intergenerational family therapy (Bowen and
      Boszormenyi-Nagy). MDFT has specific aspects: MDFT therapists think in a
      multidimensional perspective (because an adolescent's drug abuse is a
      multidimensional disorder), they work with the system and the subsystem, focusing
      on the emotional expression and the parental and adolescent enactment (a
      principle of change and intervention). MDFT includes four modules (adolescent,
      parent, family interaction, and extra-familial systems) in three steps (1) build 
      the foundation, (2) prompt action and change by working the themes, and (3) seal 
      the changes and exit). The supervision philosophy and methodology is also based
      on the principle of multidimensionality. Indeed, many different supervision
      methods are used in a coordinated way to produce the required adherence and
      clinical skill (written case conceptualizations, videotape presentation and live 
      supervision). CONCLUSION: Family vulnerability and chronicity factors are a major
      challenge of modern research. MDFT questions the reciprocal adjustments that have
      to be made by the subject and his/her familial environment. It also helps to
      clarify the therapeutic interventions in order to enhance better adolescent
      development. For this purpose, MDFT offers a specific therapeutic frame, for it
      is a family therapy focused on adolescents with cannabis abuse problems. Its
      action and questioning on parental practices and adolescents lead to better
      psycho-educational support. It focuses the therapeutic process on emotions and
      family capacity for change.

TI  - Tobacco cessation intervention for pregnant women in Argentina and Uruguay: study
      protocol.
PG  - 44
LID - 10.1186/1742-4755-10-44 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Argentina and Uruguay are among the countries with the highest
      proportion of pregnant women who smoke. The implementation of an effective
      smoking cessation intervention would have a significant impact on the health of
      mothers and infants. The "5 A's" (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) is a
      strategy consisting of a brief cessation counseling session of 5-15 minutes
      delivered by a trained provider. The "5 A's" is considered the standard of care
      worldwide; however, it is under used in Argentina and Uruguay. METHODS: We will
      conduct a two-arm, parallel cluster randomized controlled trial of an
      implementation intervention in 20 prenatal care settings in Argentina and
      Uruguay. Prenatal care settings will be randomly allocated to either an
      intervention or a control group after a baseline data collection period.
      Midwives' facilitators in the 10 intervention prenatal clinics (clusters) will be
      identified and trained to deliver the "5 A's" to pregnant women and will then
      disseminate and implement the program. The 10 clusters in the control group will 
      continue with their standard in-service activities. The intervention will be
      tailored by formative research to be readily applicable to local prenatal care
      services at maternity hospitals and acceptable to local pregnant women and health
      providers. Our primary hypothesis is that the intervention is feasible in
      prenatal clinics in Argentina and Uruguay and will increase the frequency of
      women receiving tobacco use cessation counseling during pregnancy in the
      intervention clinics compared to the control clinics. Our secondary hypotheses
      are that the intervention will decrease the frequency of women who smoke by the
      end of pregnancy, and that the intervention will increase the attitudes and
      readiness of midwives towards providing counseling to women in the intervention
      clinics compared to the control clinics.

TI  - In-work tax credits for families and their impact on health status in adults.
PG  - CD009963
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009963.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: By improving two social determinants of health (poverty and
      unemployment) in low- and middle-income families on or at risk of welfare,
      in-work tax credit for families (IWTC) interventions could impact health status
      and outcomes in adults. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of IWTCs on health
      outcomes in working-age adults (18 to 64 years). SEARCH METHODS: We searched 16
      electronic academic databases, including the Cochrane Public Health Group
      Specialised Register, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane
      Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE and EMBASE, as well as six grey literature
      databases between July and September 2012 for records published between January
      1980 and July 2012. We also searched key organisational websites, handsearched
      reference lists of included records and relevant journals, and contacted academic
      experts. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised and quasi-randomised
      controlled trials and cohort, controlled before-and-after (CBA) and interrupted
      time series (ITS) studies of IWTCs in working-age adults. Included primary
      outcomes were: self rated general health; mental health/psychological distress;
      mental illness; overweight/obesity; alcohol use and tobacco use. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the
      risk of bias in included studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing
      information. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies (one CBA and four ITS) comprising a total
      of 5,677,383 participants (all women) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were
      synthesised narratively. The in-work tax credit intervention assessed in all
      included studies is the permanent Earned Income Tax Credit in the United States, 
      established in 1975. This intervention distributed nearly USD 62 billion to over 
      27 million individuals in 2011, and its administration costs were less than one
      per cent of its total costs. All included studies carried a high risk of bias
      (especially from confounding and insufficient control for underlying time
      trends). Due to the small number of (observational) studies and their high risk
      of bias, we judged this body of evidence to have very low overall quality.One
      study found that IWTC had no detectable effect on self rated general health and
      mental health/psychological distress five years after its implementation (i.e. a 
      considerable change in the generosity of the permanent IWTC) and on
      overweight/obesity eight years after implementation. One study found no effect of
      IWTC on tobacco use five years after implementation, one a moderate reduction in 
      tobacco use one year after implementation (odds ratio 0.95, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.94 to 0.96), and one differential effects, with no effect in
      African-Americans and a large reduction in European-Americans two years after
      implementation (risk difference -11.1%, 95% CI -20.9% to -1.3%). No evidence was 
      available for the effect of IWTC on mental illness and alcohol use. No adverse
      effects of IWTC were identified.One study also found no detectable effect of IWTC
      on the number of bad physical health days and of risky biomarkers for
      inflammation, cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions eight years after
      implementation. One study found that IWTC had a large, positive effect on income 
      from wages or salaries one year after implementation. Two studies found no effect
      on employment two and five years after implementation, whereas two found a
      moderate increase five and eight years after implementation and one a large
      increase in employment due to IWTC one year after implementation.No differences
      in outcomes between groups with different educational status were found for self 
      rated health and mental health/psychological distress. In one study
      European-American women with lower levels of education were more likely to reduce
      tobacco use, while tobacco use did not change among African-American women with
      lower levels of education. However, no differences in tobacco use by educational 
      status were observed in a second study. Two studies found that the intervention
      may have reduced inequity with respect to employment, where women with less
      education were more likely to move into employment (although one did not
      establish whether this difference was statistically significant), while two
      studies found no such difference and no studies found differences by ethnic group
      on employment rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the small and
      methodologically limited existing body of evidence with a high risk of bias
      provides no evidence for an effect of in-work tax credit for families
      interventions on health status (except for mixed evidence for tobacco smoking) in
      adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Identifying the sexual and reproductive health knowledge and practice 
      of adolescents living in the town of Miranda in the Cauca department of Colombia.
      METHODS: Across-sectional, descriptive, observational study was made. The sample 
      involved 406 adolescents. Sociodemographic, knowledge-related and practice-based 
      variables were explored. RESULTS: The adolescents had high and very high levels
      of knowledge; 90.5 % of the adolescents had received information about sex and
      pregnancy; the main source of information came from their parents (67.5 %). Safe 
      sex for 26.7 % of the adolescents meant just using a condom. Regarding their
      sexuality (practice), 42 % stated that they had had sexual relationships,
      beginning on average when around 13-years-old. Condom use was the most used
      protection mechanism. 12.5 % stated that they had used psychoactive substances or
      alcohol to intensify sexual experience; 87.7 % stated that they would seek
      counselling or treatment in a hospital or health centre without telling their
      parents if they contracted a sexually- transmitted infection (STI). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The adolescents involved in this study had high levels of knowledge; however,
      such knowledge is not enough to stop them beginning their sexual life early
      and/or increasing the probability of using a condom or contraceptive when
      beginning their sexual relationships.

AB  - Overconsumption of alcohol is well known to lead to numerous health and social
      problems. Prevalence studies of United States adults found that 20% of patients
      meet criteria for an alcohol use disorder. Routine screening for alcohol use is
      recommended in primary care settings, yet little is known about the
      organizational factors that are related to successful implementation of screening
      and brief intervention (SBI) and treatment in these settings. The purpose of this
      study was to evaluate organizational attributes in primary care practices that
      were included in a practice-based research network trial to implement alcohol
      SBI. The Survey of Organizational Attributes in Primary Care (SOAPC) has reliably
      measured four factors: communication, decision-making, stress/chaos and history
      of change. This 21-item instrument was administered to 178 practice members at
      the baseline of this trial, to evaluate for relationship of organizational
      attributes to the implementation of alcohol SBI and treatment. No significant
      relationships were found correlating alcohol screening, identification of
      high-risk drinkers and brief intervention, to the factors measured in the SOAPC
      instrument. These results highlight the challenges related to the use of
      organizational survey instruments in explaining or predicting variations in
      clinical improvement. Comprehensive mixed methods approaches may be more
      effective in evaluations of the implementation of SBI and treatment.

TI  - Screening for lung cancer with low-dose computed tomography: a systematic review 
      to update the US Preventive services task force recommendation.
PG  - 411-20
LID - 10.7326/0003-4819-159-6-201309170-00690 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the
      United States. Because early-stage lung cancer is associated with lower mortality
      than late-stage disease, early detection and treatment may be beneficial.
      PURPOSE: To update the 2004 review of screening for lung cancer for the U.S.
      Preventive Services Task Force, focusing on screening with low-dose computed
      tomography (LDCT). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (2000 to 31 May 2013), the Cochrane
      Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews
      (through the fourth quarter of 2012), Scopus, and reference lists. STUDY
      SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials or cohort studies that 
      evaluated LDCT screening for lung cancer. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted
      study data about participants, design, analysis, follow-up, and results, and a
      second reviewer checked extractions. Two reviewers rated study quality using
      established criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four trials reported results of LDCT
      screening among patients with smoking exposure. One large good-quality trial
      reported that screening was associated with significant reductions in lung cancer
      (20%) and all-cause (6.7%) mortality. Three small European trials showed no
      benefit of screening. Harms included radiation exposure, overdiagnosis, and a
      high rate of false-positive findings that typically were resolved with further
      imaging. Smoking cessation was not affected. Incidental findings were common.
      LIMITATIONS: Three trials were underpowered and of insufficient duration to
      evaluate screening effectiveness. Overdiagnosis, an important harm of screening, 
      is of uncertain magnitude. No studies reported results in women or minority
      populations. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence shows that LDCT screening can reduce
      lung cancer and all-cause mortality. The harms associated with screening must be 
      balanced with the benefits. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for Healthcare
      Research and Quality.

TI  - The effectiveness of a perioperative smoking cessation program: a randomized
      clinical trial.
PG  - 605-13
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0b013e318298a6b0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking by surgical patients is associated with increased
      complications, particularly perioperative respiratory problems and poor wound
      healing. In this study, we sought to determine whether a pragmatic perioperative 
      smoking cessation intervention designed for a busy preadmission clinic would be
      successful in reducing smoking rates and intraoperative and immediate
      postoperative complications. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial was
      conducted at a university-affiliated hospital in London, Ontario, Canada.
      Patients seen in the preadmission clinic at least 3 weeks preoperatively were
      randomized to either the control group (84 patients) or the intervention group
      (84 patients). The control group received no specific smoking cessation
      intervention. The intervention group received (1) brief counseling by the
      preadmission nurse, (2) brochures on smoking cessation, (3) referral to the
      Canadian Cancer Society's Smokers' Helpline, and (4) a free 6-week supply of
      transdermal nicotine replacement therapy. All outcome assessors and caregivers on
      the operative day were blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome was the
      rate of smoking cessation as confirmed by exhaled carbon monoxide breath test.
      Secondary outcomes included perioperative complications and smoking status at 30 
      days postoperatively. RESULTS: Between October 2010 and April 2012, 168 patients 
      were recruited into the study. Smoking cessation occurred in 12 patients (14.3%) 
      in the intervention group as compared with 3 patients (3.6%) in the control group
      (relative risk 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-13.7; P = 0.03). The
      overall rate of combined intraoperative and immediate postoperative complications
      was not significantly different between intervention and control groups (13.1%
      and 16.7%, respectively; relative risk 0.79; 95% CI, 0.38-1.63; P = 0.67). At
      follow-up 30 days postoperatively, smoking cessation was reported in 22 patients 
      (28.6%) in the intervention group compared with 8 patients (11%) in controls
      (relative risk 2.6; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: One of the
      objections to widespread use of smoking cessation interventions in the
      preadmission clinic is that it is too labor-intensive. The results of this study 
      show that a smoking cessation intervention, designed to minimize additional use
      of physician or nursing time, results in decreased smoking rates on the day of
      surgery and promotes abstinence 30 days postoperatively.

TI  - Overcoming Addictions, a Web-based application, and SMART Recovery, an online and
      in-person mutual help group for problem drinkers, part 1: three-month outcomes of
      a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - e134
LID - 10.2196/jmir.2565 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Overcoming Addictions (OA) is an abstinence-oriented, cognitive
      behavioral, Web application based on the program of SMART Recovery. SMART
      Recovery is an organization that has adapted empirically supported treatment
      strategies for use in a mutual help framework with in-person meetings, online
      meetings, a forum, and other resources. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness 
      of OA and SMART Recovery (SR) with problem drinkers who were new to SMART
      Recovery. Our experimental hypotheses were: (1) all groups will reduce their
      drinking and alcohol/drug-related consequences at follow-up compared to their
      baseline levels, (2) the OA condition will reduce their drinking and
      alcohol/drug-related consequences more than the control group (SR), and (3) the
      OA+SR condition will reduce their drinking and alcohol/drug-related consequences 
      more than the control group (SR only). METHODS: We recruited 189 heavy problem
      drinkers primarily through SMART Recovery's website and in-person meetings
      throughout the United States. We randomly assigned participants to (1) OA alone, 
      (2) OA+attend SMART Recovery (SR) meetings (OA+SR), or (3) attend SR only.
      Baseline and follow-ups were conducted via GoToMeeting sessions with a Research
      Assistant (RA) and the study participant. We interviewed significant others to
      corroborate the participant's self-report. Primary outcome measures included
      percent days abstinent (PDA), mean drinks per drinking day (DDD), and
      alcohol/drug-related consequences. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat analysis of the
      3-month outcomes supported the first hypothesis but not the others. Participants 
      in all groups significantly increased their percent days abstinent from 44% to
      72% (P<.001), decreased their mean drinks per drinking day from 8.0 to 4.6
      (P<.001), and decreased their alcohol/drug-related problems (P<.001). Actual use 
      relationships were found for the OA groups, between SR online meetings and
      improvement in PDA (r=.261, P=.033). In addition in the OA groups, the number of 
      total sessions of support (including SR & other meetings, counselor visits) was
      significantly related to PDA (r=.306, P=012) and amount of improvement in
      alcohol-related problems (r=.305, P=.012). In the SR only group, the number of
      face-to-face meetings was significantly related to all three dependent variables,
      and predicted increased PDA (r=.358, P=.003), fewer mean DDD (r=-.250, P=.039),
      and fewer alcohol-related problems (r=-.244, P=.045), as well as to the amount of
      improvement in all three of these variables. Six-month follow-ups have been
      completed, and the results are currently being analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: These
      results support our first experimental hypothesis but not the second or third.
      All groups significantly increased their PDA and decreased both their mean DDD
      and their alcohol-related problems, which indicates that both interventions being
      investigated were equally effective in helping people recover from their problem 
      drinking.

AB  - Persons with known coronary heart disease (CHD) are at a greater risk of
      subsequent events. The current guidelines for secondary prevention have focused
      on lifestyle modifications, risk factor control, and drug therapy. However,
      current data lack information on the United States population and its adherence
      to these guidelines. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition
      Examination Survey from 2007 to 2010, we identified those with CHD and assessed
      the adequacy of their adherence to the current guidelines for secondary
      prevention. Of 759 subjects with CHD (weighted to 12.7 million), the use of
      recommended therapies was 55%, 45%, and 62% for beta blockers,
      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and
      lipid-lowering agents, respectively (24% for all), with adherence lower in women 
      than in men and in blacks and Hispanics than in whites. The nonsmoking status and
      control of blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and, for those
      with diabetes, glycated hemoglobin was 73%, 67%, 59%, 60%, respectively (14% for 
      all). Also, 17%, 70%, and 7% were at the recommended levels for physical
      activity, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake, respectively. Moreover, only
      20% and 29% were at the recommended body mass index and waist circumference
      targets, respectively. Those with metabolic syndrome and diabetes were more
      likely to have >/=2 risk factors uncontrolled, despite being more likely to be
      receiving recommended therapies. A significant gap still exists between the
      secondary prevention guidelines and their adherence and control of CHD risk
      factors among United States adults. In conclusion, greater efforts are needed to 
      ensure adherence to all aspects of secondary prevention guidelines to optimize
      the prognosis in subjects with CHD.

AB  - The effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in preventing
      disease progression can be negatively influenced by the high prevalence of
      substance use among patients. Here, we quantify the effect of history of
      injection drug use and alcoholism on virologic and immunologic response to HAART.
      Clinical and survey data, collected at the start of HAART and at the interview
      date, were based on the study Longitudinal Investigations into Supportive and
      Ancillary Health Services (LISA) in British Columbia, Canada. Substance use was a
      three-level categorical variable, combining information on history of alcohol
      dependence and of injection drug use, defined as: no history of alcohol and
      injection drug use; history of alcohol or injection drug use; and history of both
      alcohol and injection drug use. Virologic response (pVL) was defined by >/= 2
      log10 copy/mL drop in a viral load. Immunologic response was defined as an
      increase in CD4 cell count percent of >/= 100%. We used cumulative logit modeling
      for ordinal responses to address our objective. Of the 537 HIV-infected patients,
      112 (21%) were characterized as having a history of both alcohol and injection
      drug use, 173 (32%) were nonadherent (<95%), 196 (36%) had a CD4(+)/pVL(+) (Best)
      response, 180 (34%) a CD4(+)/pVL(-) or a CD4(-) /pVL(+) (Incomplete) response,
      and 161 (30%) a CD4(-) /pVL(-) (Worst) response. For individuals with history of 
      both alcohol and injection drug use, the estimated probability of non-adherence
      was 0.61, and (0.15, 0.25, 0.60) of Best, Incomplete and Worse responses,
      respectively. Screening and detection of substance dependence will identify
      individuals at high-risk for nonadherence and ideally prevent their HIV disease
      from progressing to advanced stages where HIV disease can become difficult to
      manage.

PG  - CD009287
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009287.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substance-specific mass media campaigns which address young people
      are widely used to prevent illicit drug use. They aim to reduce use and raise
      awareness of the problem. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of mass media
      campaigns in preventing or reducing the use of or intention to use illicit drugs 
      amongst young people. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register
      of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 1), including the
      Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group's Specialised Register; MEDLINE through PubMed
      (from 1966 to 29 January 2013); EMBASE (from 1974 to 30 January 2013) and
      ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I (from 1861 to 3 February 2013). SELECTION
      CRITERIA: Cluster-randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective
      cohort studies, interrupted time series and controlled before and after studies
      evaluating the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in influencing drug use,
      intention to use or the attitude of young people under the age of 26 towards
      illicit drugs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological 
      procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. MAIN RESULTS: We included 23 studies
      involving 188,934 young people, conducted in the USA, Canada and Australia
      between 1991 and 2012. Twelve studies were randomised controlled trials (RCT),
      two were prospective cohort studies (PCS), one study was both a RCT and a PCS,
      six were interrupted time series and two were controlled before and after (CBA)
      studies. The RCTs had an overall low risk of bias, along with the ITS (apart from
      the dimension 'formal test of trend'), and the PCS had overall good quality,
      apart from the description of loss to follow-up by exposure.Self reported or
      biomarker-assessed illicit drug use was measured with an array of published and
      unpublished scales making comparisons difficult. Pooled results of five RCTs (N =
      5470) show no effect of media campaign intervention (standardised mean difference
      (SMD) -0.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.12).We also pooled five ITS 
      studies (N = 26,405) focusing specifically on methamphetamine use. Out of four
      pooled estimates (two endpoints measured in two age groups), there was evidence
      of a reduction only in past-year prevalence of methamphetamine use among 12 to 17
      years old.A further five studies (designs = one RCT with PCS, two PCS, two ITS,
      one CBA, N = 151,508), which could not be included in meta-analyses, reported a
      drug use outcome with varied results including a clear iatrogenic effect in one
      case and reduction of use in another. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall the available
      evidence does not allow conclusions about the effect of media campaigns on
      illicit drug use among young people. We conclude that further studies are needed.

LID - 10.1097/YCO.0b013e328361e814 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adolescence is a developmental period characterized by
      relatively high rates of substance use and substance use disorders. Precise
      assessment and classification of adolescent drug use behaviors are essential in
      gaining an accurate understanding of the nature and extent of adolescent drug
      use, and possible intervention or treatment needs. There has been a select group 
      of recently published research reports and manuscripts that address critical and 
      emerging issues pertaining to the classification and assessment of alcohol and
      other drug use behaviors among adolescents. An overview of these publications is 
      provided and their clinical relevance is discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The paper
      will focus on recent research, most from the United States, that addresses four
      main issues. One is the application of the new DSM-5 criteria to adolescents,
      including the advantages and disadvantages of the new criteria for substance use 
      disorders. The second issue pertains to advances in instrumentation that provide 
      new tools for researchers and clinicians in assessing substance use in
      adolescents. A significant public health issue is addressed as the third theme in
      the paper - screening for alcohol abuse in college settings. Finally, the paper
      reviews how the emerging science of brain development can inform the assessment
      process. SUMMARY: Recent advances in the adolescent drug abuse assessment field
      continue to inform clinical service and research. As a whole, these advances have
      strengthened the field, but continued research is needed to further refine
      assessment practices and standards and to better understand how to define a
      substance use disorder in youth.

TI  - Ayahuasca-assisted therapy for addiction: results from a preliminary
      observational study in Canada.
PG  - 30-42
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This paper reports results from a preliminary observational study
      of ayahuasca-assisted treatment for problematic substance use and stress
      delivered in a rural First Nations community in British Columbia, Canada.
      METHODS: The "Working with Addiction and Stress" retreats combined four days of
      group counselling with two expert-led ayahuasca ceremonies. This study collected 
      pre-treatment and six months follow-up data from 12 participants on several
      psychological and behavioral factors related to problematic substance use, and
      qualitative data assessing the personal experiences of the participants six
      months after the retreat. FINDINGS: Statistically significant (p < 0.05)
      improvements were demonstrated for scales assessing hopefulness, empowerment,
      mindfulness, and quality of life meaning and outlook subscales. Self-reported
      alcohol, tobacco and cocaine use declined, although cannabis and opiate use did
      not; reported reductions in problematic cocaine use were statistically
      significant. All study participants reported positive and lasting changes from
      participating in the retreats. CONCLUSIONS: This form of ayahuasca-assisted
      therapy appears to be associated with statistically significant improvements in
      several factors related to problematic substance use among a rural aboriginal
      population. These findings suggest participants may have experienced positive
      psychological and behavioral changes in response to this therapeutic approach,
      and that more rigorous research of ayahuasca-assisted therapy for problematic
      substance use is warranted.

BTI - Screening for Oral Cancer: A Targeted Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive
      Services Task Force
AB  - To assess whether screening for oral cancer reduces morbidity or mortality and to
      determine the performance characteristics of the oral screening examination for
      cancer or potentially malignant disorders (PMDs). Building on previous searches, 
      we searched Medline from January 2008 through July 2011. We supplemented searches
      with bibliographies from retrieved articles and from previous U.S. Preventive
      Services Task Force (USPSTF) reviews. One investigator reviewed citations at the 
      title and abstract level; two investigators independently reviewed potentially
      relevant citations at the full-text level using predefined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. A single investigator extracted study characteristics and
      results; a second investigator confirmed data. Two investigators rated the
      studies for internal validity using USPSTF criteria. Evidence was described in
      text and tables and summarized by qualitative analysis. Evidence for the effect
      of oral screening on morbidity and mortality came from a single, large
      randomized, controlled trial (n=191,873) conducted in a population with high
      disease prevalence using home-based screening by advanced health workers.
      Screened subjects had no significant difference in incidence or mortality rates
      from oral cancer compared with subjects who were not screened. However, screened 
      subjects had oral cancer diagnosed at lower stages and with greater 5-year
      survival. Within the subgroup who used tobacco or alcohol (n=84,600), screened
      subjects had a lower mortality rate from oral cancer than subjects who were not
      screened. Evidence for the performance characteristics of the screening
      examination came from seven primary studies (n=49,120), most conducted in
      settings with much higher incidence and mortality from oral cancer than the
      United States. Studies also had considerable heterogeneity in design and showed
      wide variation in performance characteristics. Screening examinations by general 
      dentists in the United Kingdom among 2,336 presumably higher-risk patients age 40
      years and older showed sensitivity for oral cancer or PMD of 71 to 74 percent,
      with positive predictive value of 67 to 86 percent and specificity of 98 to 99
      percent. Adding toluidine blue dye to a screening examination did not
      significantly change its performance, as measured by the malignant transformation
      rate or incidence of oral cancer. We found no evidence on screening either a
      general or a selected high-risk population for oral cancer in the United States. 
      Screening subjects in a high-prevalence population outside the United States
      lowered the stage of oral cancer at diagnosis and improved 5-year survival.
      However, survival differences could represent length or lead-time bias. Screening
      subjects in the subgroup who used tobacco or alcohol reduced the mortality rate
      from oral cancer. Subgroup analyses, however, were post-hoc and should be viewed 
      as exploratory. The performance characteristics of the screening examination
      varied widely, with applicable results only from dentists addressing higher-risk 
      patients in the United Kingdom. However, sensitivity and specificity estimates
      were for PMDs as well as cancers, and do not represent a clear screening strategy
      that is applicable to U.S. practice. We found no evidence that any adjunctive
      device affects the performance of the screening examination.

TI  - Getting it right from birth to kindergarten: what's new in the Rourke Baby
      Record?
PG  - 355-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the 2011 edition of the Rourke Baby Record
      (RBR), which includes developments on its website and new related initiatives
      that incorporate recent literature on preventive health care for children aged 0 
      to 5 years. QUALITY OF EVIDENCE: As in past RBR editions, recommendations are
      identified as supported by good, fair, or consensus evidence, according to the
      classifications adopted by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care in
      2011. MAIN MESSAGE: New information and recommendations are given for growth
      monitoring, nutrition, physical examination maneuvers, and immunizations for
      varicella, pneumococcus, meningococcus, and rotavirus. There is now good evidence
      for converting to the World Health Organization growth charts adapted for Canada,
      universal newborn hearing screening, and use of immunization pain reduction
      strategies. Anticipatory guidance has been updated for safe sleeping, health
      supervision of foster children, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, lead and anemia 
      screening risk factors, and dental care and oral health. New RBR website items
      include a parent resources section, modifications for unique populations such as 
      those living in Nunavut, a version of the RBR that highlights what has changed
      from the 2009 version for quick viewing, and an expansion of the "Explore the
      RBR" feature with associated links to relevant information. A one-visit-per-page 
      format is now available. The 2011 RBR is endorsed by the College of Family
      Physicians of Canada and the Canadian Paediatric Society, and is available in
      English and French in national and Ontario versions. CONCLUSION: The 2011 RBR is 
      an updated, evidence-based, practical knowledge translation tool for preventive
      health care for infants from birth to age 5 years that includes extensive
      Web-based resources for health care professionals, students, residents, and
      parents.

TI  - A multisite, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of vigabatrin for treating cocaine dependence.
PG  - 630-7
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.872 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Cocaine dependence is a significant public health problem, yet no
      validated pharmacological treatment exists. The potent gamma-aminobutyric acid
      (GABA)ergic medication vigabatrin has previously been shown to be effective in a 
      double-blind single-site study conducted in Mexico. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of vigabatrin for the treatment of cocaine dependence in a
      U.S. sample. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multisite, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, 12-week clinical trial with follow-up visits at weeks 13, 16,
      20, and 24 in 11 U.S. sites. PARTICIPANTS: In total, 186 treatment-seeking
      participants with cocaine dependence (mean age, 45 years). Approximately 67% were
      male, and about 60% were of African American race/ethnicity. INTERVENTIONS:
      Participants received twice-daily doses of vigabatrin (total dosage, 3.0 g/d) or 
      matched placebo, plus weekly computerized cognitive behavioral therapy and
      biweekly individual counseling for 13 weeks. Contingency management encouraged
      the provision of urine samples. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome
      measure was the proportion of participants with cocaine abstinence during the
      last 2 weeks of the 12-week treatment phase as assessed by self-reports and
      quantitative urine drug screens. The weekly fraction of cocaine use days and the 
      number of drug-free urine samples during weeks 1 through 13 were key secondary
      measures. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed between the
      vigabatrin group and the placebo group on the primary outcome measure (P = .67), 
      key secondary measures (P > .99), or other outcome measures. However, while pill 
      counts and self-reports indicated that more than 66% of all participants (and
      >63% of the vigabatrin group) took more than 70% of their medication, post hoc
      vigabatrin urine concentration levels suggested that approximately 40% to 60% of 
      patients taking vigabatrin may not have been adherent. This lack of adherence may
      have obscured any evidence of vigabatrin efficacy. No visual acuity or visual
      field deterioration occurred in any of the participants. CONCLUSIONS AND
      RELEVANCE: No protocol-defined differences in efficacy between vigabatrin
      treatment and placebo were detected for any outcome variable. This may have been 
      due to medication nonadherence or, alternatively, due to the weak efficacy of
      vigabatrin. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00611130.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether telephone-based smoking cessation follow-up
      counseling (FC), when delivered as part of a multi-component intervention program
      is associated with increased rates of follow-up support and smoking abstinence.
      METHODS: A cluster randomized controlled-trial was conducted within family
      medicine practices in Ontario, Canada. Consecutive adult patients who smoked were
      enrolled at two time points, the baseline period (2009) and the post-intervention
      period (2009-2011). Smoking abstinence was determined by telephone interview 4
      months following enrollment. Both groups implemented a multi-component
      intervention program. Practices randomized to the FC group could also refer
      patients to a follow-up support program which involved 5 telephone contacts over 
      a 2-month period. RESULTS: Eight practices, 130 providers, and 928 eligible
      patients participated in the study. No statistically significant difference in
      7-day point-prevalence abstinence was observed between intervention groups. There
      was a significant increase in referral to follow-up in both intervention groups. 
      Significantly higher rates of smoking abstinence [25.7% vs. 11.3%; adjusted OR

TI  - Eight ways to stay healthy after cancer: an evidence-based message.
PG  - 827-37
LID - 10.1007/s10552-013-0179-z [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Since 1999, in conjunction with the internationally known and
      award-winning Your Disease Risk ( yourdiseaserisk.org ) risk assessment tool, the
      "Eight Ways to Stay Healthy and Prevent Cancer" message campaign has provided an 
      evidence-based, but user-friendly, approach to cancer prevention. The scientific 
      evidence behind the campaign is robust and while not a complete list, provides a 
      great deal of benefit in the reduction of cancer risk. With 12 million cancer
      survivors in the United States, there is a need for a parallel set of
      recommendations that oncologists and primary care providers may routinely use for
      individuals following a cancer diagnosis focused on improving the quantity and
      quality of life after diagnosis. With increasing survival rates and many cancer
      survivors dying from noncancer causes, survivorship care necessarily focuses on
      more than just risk of cancer recurrence and cancer-related mortality. METHODS:
      To provide a foundation for living a healthy life after a cancer diagnosis, we
      developed a set of evidence-based health messages for cancer survivors. "Cancer
      Survivors' Eight Ways to Stay Healthy After Cancer," published by the Siteman
      Cancer Center at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes Jewish
      Hospital, documents both the evidence supporting the recommendations as well as
      tips for implementing them. RESULTS: The one-line summary messages are: (1) don't
      smoke, (2) avoid secondhand smoke, (3) exercise regularly, (4) avoid weight gain,
      (5) eat a healthy diet, (6) drink alcohol in moderation, if at all, (7) stay
      connected with friends, family, and other survivors, (8) get screening tests and 
      go to your regular checkups. CONCLUSIONS: The cancer survivors' eight ways are
      the foundation for an evidence-based health promotion program for survivors.

      associations between organizational climate and practice.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/1940-0640-8-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have demonstrated that positive organizational
      climates contribute to better work performance. Screening and brief intervention 
      (SBI) for alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use has the potential to reach a broad
      population of hazardous drug users but has not yet been widely adopted in
      Brazil's health care system. We surveyed 149 primary health care professionals in
      30 clinics in Brazil who were trained to conduct SBI among their patients. We
      prospectively measured how often they delivered SBI to evaluate the association
      between organizational climate and adoption/performance of SBI. METHODS:
      Organizational climate was measured by the 2009 Organizational Climate Scale for 
      Health Organizations, a scale validated in Brazil that assesses leadership,
      professional development, team spirit, relationship with the community, safety,
      strategy, and remuneration. Performance of SBI was measured prospectively by
      weekly assessments during the three months following training. We also assessed
      self-reported SBI and self-efficacy for performing SBI at three months
      post-training. We used inferential statistics to depict and test for the
      significance of associations. RESULTS: Teams with better organizational climates 
      implemented SBI more frequently. Organizational climate factors most closely
      associated with SBI implementation included professional development and
      relationship with the community. The dimensions of leadership and remuneration
      were also significantly associated with SBI. CONCLUSIONS: Organizational climate 
      may influence implementation of SBI and ultimately may affect the ability of
      organizations to identify and address drug use.

AB  - Ondansetron has emerged as a promising medication for the treatment of alcohol
      dependence, mainly among early-onset alcoholics. This research primarily aimed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of ondansetron at a 16mg/day dosage to treat
      alcohol-dependent outpatients. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week study 
      was carried out at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The total sample
      comprised 102 men, 18-60 years of age, with an International Classification of
      Diseases (ICD-10) diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Half of our sample
      discontinued the treatment and the main outcome measures (proportion of abstinent
      days and proportion of heavy drinking days) were analyzed using the treatment
      adherents as well as with an imputed sample. The main factors associated with
      treatment retention were older age and smoking status. Although there were no
      significant differences between the main outcome measures of both medication
      groups in the adherents, ondansetron demonstrated a slight but significant
      superiority over the placebo regarding the proportion of heavy drinking days in
      the imputed sample (7.8% versus 11.7%, respectively). It appears that the optimal
      dosage to treat alcoholism has yet to be determined. Further, ondansetron may
      only be useful in treating some types of alcoholics. Ondansetron was well
      tolerated and no serious adverse events were registered.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the efficacy of 0.8% arginine, potassium nitrate and sodium
      fluoride mouthwashes on dentine hypersensitivity reduction. METHODS: Six week
      randomized, double blinded, two cell, parallel single centre clinical study in
      the Dominican Republic; subjects were randomized into three treatment groups:
      mouthwash containing 0.8% arginine, PVM/MA copolymer, pyrophosphates, and 0.05%
      sodium fluoride in an alcohol-free base (arginine); mouthwash containing 2.4%
      potassium nitrate and 0.022% sodium fluoride (potassium nitrate); a control
      mouthwash containing 0.05% sodium fluoride (negative control). Tactile and
      air-blast dentine hypersensitivity assessments were conducted at baseline, thirty
      minutes post rinsing and two, four, and six weeks of twice-daily product use. For
      treatment group comparisons, ANCOVA and post hoc Tukey's pair-wise comparisons
      (alpha=0.05) were done. RESULTS: Seventy-five subjects were enrolled; 69 subjects
      completed the study. There were no differences after thirty minutes of a single
      use, among the three groups with respect to mean tactile and air blast
      hypersensitivity scores compared to potassium nitrate and negative control
      mouthwashes (p<0.05). The arginine group presented a statistically significant
      improvement in the mean tactile scores compared to potassium nitrate and negative
      control groups after two, four, and six weeks (p<0.001) of product use; the
      arginine group showed a statistically significant enhancement in air blast
      hypersensitivity mean scores compared to potassium nitrate and negative control
      groups after two (p=0.001), four (p<0.001), and six weeks (p<0.001) of product
      use. CONCLUSION: A mouthwash containing arginine provides a significant and
      superior reduction in dentine hypersensitivity compared to potassium nitrate and 
      a negative control mouthwash after two weeks.

AB  - Adolescence is a period of rapid biological, psychological, and social
      development in the human life cycle. Drug and alcohol misuse during this critical
      period poses substantial problems for individual and public health, yet is highly
      prevalent in the United States and elsewhere. The screening, brief interventions,
      and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model may be well-suited for identifying and
      intervening with adolescents who are at-risk of developing substance use
      disorders and those adolescents whose substance use puts them at risk for injury 
      or illness. This article reviews the literature on SBIRT for adolescent
      populations, focusing on findings from randomized controlled trials. The limited 
      evidence suggests that brief interventions may be effective with adolescents, but
      a number of gaps in the literature were identified. Considerations for
      implementing SBIRT with adolescent populations are discussed. Randomized trials
      are needed that have adequate statistical power, employ longer-term follow-ups,
      and test the effectiveness of SBIRT for adolescents in various service delivery
      settings.

      strategies, including efforts to prevent and treat substance use and related
      problems. Latin America and the Caribbean is a rich and diverse region of the
      world with a large range of social and cultural influences. A working group
      constituted by the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Center
      for Addiction and Mental Health in June, 2010 identified research on this
      relationship as a priority area for a multinational research partnership.
      METHODS: This paper examines the association between self-reported child
      maltreatment and use in the past 12 months of alcohol and cannabis in 2294
      university students in seven participating universities in six participating
      countries: Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama and Uruguay. The
      research also considers the possible impact of religiosity and minimal
      psychological distress as factors contributing to resiliency in these samples.
      RESULTS: The results showed that experience of maltreatment was associated with
      increased use of alcohol and cannabis. However, the effects differed depending on
      the type of maltreatment experienced. Higher levels of religiosity were
      consistently associated with lower levels of alcohol and cannabis use, but we
      found no evidence of an impact of minimal psychological distress on these
      measures. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study shows that the experience of
      maltreatment may increase the risk of alcohol and cannabis use among university
      students in Latin American and Caribbean countries, but that higher levels of
      religiosity may reduce that risk. More work to determine the nature and
      significance of these relationships is needed.

BTI - Screening for Hepatitis C Virus Infection in Adults
AB  - Many patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are unaware of their
      status. Screening could identify patients at earlier stages of disease, when
      interventions might be effective in improving clinical outcomes or reducing
      transmission risk. The purpose of this report is to systematically review the
      evidence on screening for HCV infection in asymptomatic adults without known
      liver enzyme abnormalities, including pregnant women. This review focuses on
      research gaps identified in the 2004 United States Preventive Services Task Force
      (USPSTF) review and new studies published since that review, and it reviews
      evidence on prenatal HCV screening not included in the 2004 USPSTF review. This
      report examines both direct evidence on the effects of screening for HCV
      infection compared to no screening on clinical outcomes, as well as the indirect 
      chain of evidence (diagnosis, workup, and treatment) needed to understand effects
      of screening on clinical outcomes. Treatments evaluated included immunizations,
      counseling, and interventions to potentially reduce risk of mother-to-child
      transmission. To complement this review of screening for HCV, the Agency for
      Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) commissioned a separate review on
      effectiveness of antiviral treatments. Articles were identified from searches
      (from 1947 to May 2012) of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EBM Reviews, and Ovid MEDLINE(R).
      The searches were supplemented by reviewing reference lists and searching
      clinical trial registries. We used predefined criteria to determine study
      eligibility. We selected randomized trials and observational studies that
      evaluated effects of screening, counseling interventions, and immunizations on
      clinical and intermediate outcomes. We also selected studies that evaluated
      effects of labor and delivery practices and breastfeeding on mother-to-child
      transmission of HCV infection. We selected studies that evaluated the diagnostic 
      accuracy of noninvasive tests compared to liver biopsy for diagnosing fibrosis or
      cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV infection. The quality of included studies
      was assessed, data were extracted, and results were summarized. Of the 10,786
      citations identified at the title and abstract level, we screened and reviewed
      808 full-length articles. A total of 182 studies were included. There was no
      direct evidence on clinical benefits associated with screening compared with no
      screening (or comparing different screening approaches) in nonpregnant or
      pregnant adults. Retrospective studies found that screening strategies targeting 
      multiple risk factors were associated with sensitivities of over 90 percent and
      numbers needed to screen to identify one case of HCV infection of less than 20.
      Narrowly targeted screening strategies based on history of intravenous drug use
      were associated with numbers needed to screen of less than two, but missed up to 
      two-thirds of infected people. Data on harms of screening (such as labeling and
      anxiety) were sparse. Compared with liver biopsy, a number of indices based on
      panels of blood tests were associated with a median area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.75 to 0.86 for diagnosing fibrosis
      and a median AUROC of 0.80 to 0.91 for diagnosing cirrhosis, but there was
      insufficient evidence to determine clinical outcomes associated with strategies
      incorporating noninvasive tests for evaluating patients with HCV infection.
      Limited evidence suggested that knowledge of HCV status and counseling
      interventions may reduce alcohol use and risky injection drug use behaviors, but 
      more evidence is needed to demonstrate long-term sustainability and to understand
      effects on clinical outcomes and transmission risk. In pregnant women, cohort
      studies found no clear association between mode of delivery and risk of vertical 
      transmission of HCV infection and consistently found no association between
      breastfeeding and transmission risk. Evidence on the association between other
      labor and delivery management practices and risk of vertical transmission of HCV 
      infection was sparse, but suggested that prolonged rupture of membranes is
      associated with increased risk. Although screening tests can accurately identify 
      adults with chronic HCV infection, targeted screening strategies based on the
      presence of risk factors miss some patients with HCV infection. As a result, more
      research is needed to understand the effects of different screening strategies on
      clinical outcomes. Evidence on effects of knowledge of HCV status and counseling 
      and immunizations on clinical and intermediate outcomes in patients diagnosed
      with HCV infection remains sparse and more research is needed to understand
      effective interventions for preventing vertical transmission. A complete
      assessment of benefits and harms of screening requires consideration of the
      effectiveness of antiviral regimens, which are the subject of a complementary
      review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2005, the American College of Surgeons passed a mandate requiring
      that Level I trauma centers have a mechanism to identify patients who are problem
      drinkers and have the capacity to provide an intervention for patients who screen
      positive. The aim of the Disseminating Organizational Screening and Brief
      Intervention Services (DO-SBIS) cluster randomized trial is to test a multilevel 
      intervention targeting the implementation of high-quality alcohol screening and
      brief intervention (SBI) services at trauma centers. METHOD: Twenty sites
      selected from all United States Level I trauma centers were randomized to
      participate in the trial. Intervention site providers receive a combination of
      workshop training in evidence-based motivational interviewing (MI) interventions 
      and organizational development activities prior to conducting trauma-center-based
      alcohol SBI with blood-alcohol-positive injured patients. Control sites implement
      care as usual. Provider MI skills, patient alcohol consumption, and
      organizational acceptance of SBI implementation outcomes are assessed. RESULTS:
      The investigation has successfully recruited provider, patient and trauma center 
      staff samples into the study, and outcomes are being followed longitudinally.
      CONCLUSION: When completed, the DO-SBIS trial will inform future American College
      of Surgeons' policy targeting the sustained integration of high-quality alcohol
      SBI at trauma centers nationwide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess factors associated with previous exposure 
      to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Brazilian adults in mental health
      centers. METHOD: A cross-sectional national multicenter study of 2087 psychiatric
      patients randomly selected from 26 public mental health services was conducted
      between 2005 and 2007 in Brazil. An interview was conducted for obtaining
      sociodemographic, clinical and behavioral data. Psychiatric diagnoses were
      obtained from medical charts. Serology testing was conducted using anti-HCV. The 
      magnitude of the associations was estimated by the prevalence rate ratio under
      Poisson distribution. Multivariate analysis for previous HCV exposure was carried
      out by weighted Poisson regression. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of previous 
      HCV exposure was 2.53% (95% confidence interval: 2.22-2.83). Factors associated
      with previous exposure to HCV infection included male gender; age >/= 40 years;
      history of sexually transmitted infections; current tobacco use; lifetime
      injecting drug use; exchange of money/drugs for sex; and main psychiatric
      diagnoses of psychoses and bipolar disorders, substance use disorders or
      dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a high prevalence of previous
      exposure to HCV in this population of Brazilian psychiatric patients. Most
      factors statistically associated with HCV were demographic or behavioral related,
      indicating a potential high-vulnerability profile. Screening for HCV in high-risk
      patients should be routine practices in these mental health services in Brazil.

TI  - Efficacy of acamprosate for alcohol dependence in a family medicine setting in
      the United States: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 668-74
LID - 10.1111/acer.12010 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acamprosate has been found to enhance rates of complete abstinence
      and to increase percent days abstinent (PDA) from alcohol relative to placebo
      treatment. As most U.S. clinical trials of acamprosate have been conducted in
      alcohol and other drug specialty clinics, there is a need to examine the efficacy
      of acamprosate in generalist settings. This study tested the efficacy of
      acamprosate versus placebo on the primary study outcome of PDA in the treatment
      of alcohol-dependent patients in a family medicine setting. Secondary study
      outcomes included percent heavy drinking days (%HDD) and gamma
      glutamyltransferase level (normal or high). METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel group design of acamprosate was conducted in 2
      family medicine settings (North Carolina and Wisconsin). One hundred volunteers
      were recruited primarily by advertisement, and participants were assigned to 666 
      mg (2 pills) oral acamprosate 3 times daily (1,998 mg/d) or matching placebo over
      a 12-week period. All participants concomitantly received 5 sessions of a brief
      behavioral intervention from a family/primary care physician. RESULTS: No
      significant treatment effect of acamprosate was found on PDA or the secondary
      outcomes. Significant treatment goal by time interaction effects was found on PDA
      and %HDD. Participants who had an initial goal of abstinence versus a reduction
      in alcohol use improved on average over time in PDA and had less %HDD from
      baseline to the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not find
      evidence of efficacy for acamprosate compared to placebo among alcohol-dependent 
      individuals recruited primarily by advertisement as studied in a primary care
      setting. Drinking outcomes significantly improved regardless of medication
      condition. A goal of abstinence was significantly associated with improved
      drinking outcomes, suggesting that alcohol-dependent patients with such a goal
      may do particularly well with counseling in a family medicine setting.

TI  - Clinical preventive services in Guatemala: a cross-sectional survey of internal
      medicine physicians.
PG  - e48640
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0048640 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Guatemala is currently undergoing an epidemiologic transition.
      Preventive services are key to reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases, 
      and smoking counseling and cessation are among the most cost-effective and
      wide-reaching strategies. Internal medicine physicians are fundamental to
      providing such services, and their knowledge is a cornerstone of non-communicable
      disease control. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2011
      to evaluate knowledge of clinical preventive services for non-communicable
      diseases. Interns, residents, and attending physicians of the internal medicine
      departments of all teaching hospitals in Guatemala completed a self-administered 
      questionnaire. Participants' responses were contrasted with the Guatemalan
      Ministry of Health (MoH) prevention guidelines and the US Preventive Services
      Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations. Analysis compared knowledge of
      recommendations within and between hospitals. RESULTS: In response to simulated
      patient scenarios, all services were recommended by more than half of physicians 
      regardless of MoH or USPSTF recommendations. Prioritization was adequate
      according to the MoH guidelines but not including other potentially effective
      services (e.g. colorectal cancer and lipid disorder screenings). With the
      exception of colorectal and prostate cancer screening, less frequently
      recommended by interns, there was no difference in recommendation rates by level.
      CONCLUSION: Guatemalan internal medicine physicians' knowledge on preventive
      services recommendations for non-communicable diseases is limited, and
      prioritization did not reflect cost-effectiveness. Based on these data we
      recommend that preventive medicine training be strengthened and development of
      evidence-based guidelines for low-middle income countries be a priority.

TI  - Measuring urinary incontinence in a population of women in northern Mexico:
      prevalence and severity.
PG  - 847-54
LID - 10.1007/s00192-012-1949-y [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to estimate the prevalence
      of urinary incontinence and its associated risk factors among women in northern
      Mexico. The type and severity of incontinence were also assessed. METHODS: This
      cross-sectional population-based study assessed self-reported urinary
      incontinence in a random sample of 1,307 women aged 25-54 years. Logistic
      regression was used to estimate the association of urinary incontinence with
      sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics and other medical conditions.
      RESULTS: Overall, 18.4% of participants reported having involuntary loss of urine
      at some time within the last 12 months (95% CI, 16.4-20.7%). Among women
      reporting urinary incontinence, stress incontinence was the most common form
      (56.8%), followed by mixed (31.1%) and urge incontinence (10.0%). Approximately
      half of the women with urinary incontinence symptoms reported a severity index of
      moderate (25.8%) to severe (26.2%), with 30% stating that their leakage was
      extremely bothersome. Forty percent of incontinent women reported use of some
      sort of protection, although only 28% had ever talked to a physician about their 
      symptoms. In adjusted analyses, high body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2),
      chronic urinary tract infections, and a history of a hysterectomy or uterine
      leiomyomata were associated with increased odds of reporting incontinence
      symptoms. Increased odds of reporting severe urinary incontinence was associated 
      with chronic urinary tract infections, current smoking and high BMI. CONCLUSION: 
      Our results suggest that there might be a need to develop a culturally sensitive 
      screening questionnaire in order to identify and counsel women with mild
      incontinence symptoms in the primary care setting.

TI  - Quitline cessation counseling for young adult smokers: a randomized clinical
      trial.
PG  - 932-41
LID - 10.1093/ntr/nts227 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: One in 5 young adults in the United States currently smoke, and
      young adults are less likely than other smokers to make aided quit attempts.
      Telephone quitlines may be a useful tool for treating this population. This study
      tested a quitline-based smoking cessation intervention versus mailed self-help
      materials in smokers 18-24 years old. METHODS: This was a 2-group randomized
      clinical trial. The quitline-based counseling intervention (CI) included up to 4 
      proactive telephone counseling sessions; participants in the self-help (SH) group
      received only mailed cessation materials. Participants included 410 young adults 
      who had smoked at least 1 cigarette in the past 30 days and who called the
      Wisconsin Tobacco Quit Line (WTQL) for help with quitting. Primary study outcomes
      included whether or not a quit date was set, whether or not a serious quit
      attempt was undertaken, and self-reported 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at
      1-, 3-, and 6-month postenrollment. RESULTS: The CI and SH groups did not differ 
      in the intent-to-treat abstinence analyses at any of the follow-ups. However, the
      CI group was significantly more likely to set a quit date at 1-month
      postenrollment. Follow-up response rates were low (67.8% at 1 month; 53.4% at 3
      months; and 48.3% at 6 months) reflecting lower motivation to participate in this
      kind of research. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to self-help, quitline counseling
      motivated young adults to set a quit date but abstinence rates were not improved.
      Research is needed on how to motivate young adult smokers to seek cessation
      treatment including quitline services.

TI  - Behavioral counseling after screening for alcohol misuse in primary care: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 645-54
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse, which includes the full spectrum from risky drinking 
      to alcohol dependence, is a leading cause of preventable death in the United
      States. PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling
      interventions for adolescents and adults who misuse alcohol. DATA SOURCES:
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International
      Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and reference lists of published literature (January
      1985 through January 2012, limited to English-language articles). STUDY
      SELECTION: Controlled trials at least 6 months' duration that enrolled persons
      with alcohol misuse identified by screening in primary care settings and
      evaluated behavioral counseling interventions. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer
      extracted data and a second checked accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned 
      quality ratings and graded the strength of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 23
      included trials generally excluded persons with alcohol dependence. The best
      evidence was for brief (10- to 15-minute) multicontact interventions. Among
      adults receiving behavioral interventions, consumption decreased by 3.6 drinks
      per week from baseline (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/wk [95% CI, 2.4 to
      4.8 drinks/wk]; 10 trials; 4332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported heavy
      drinking episodes (risk difference, 0.12 [CI, 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 trials; 2737
      participants), and 11% more adults reported drinking less than the recommended
      limits (risk difference, 0.11 [CI, 0.08 to 0.13]; 9 trials; 5973 participants)
      over 12 months compared with control participants (moderate strength of
      evidence). Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about accidents,
      injuries, or alcohol-related liver problems. Trials enrolling young adults or
      college students showed reduced consumption and fewer heavy drinking episodes
      (moderate strength of evidence). Little or no evidence of harms was found.
      LIMITATIONS: Results may be biased to the null because the behavior of control
      participants could have been affected by alcohol misuse assessments. In addition,
      evidence is probably inapplicable to persons with alcohol dependence and
      selective reporting may have occurred. CONCLUSION: Behavioral counseling
      interventions improve behavioral outcomes for adults with risky drinking. PRIMARY

TI  - Benchmarking curriculum content in entry-level health professional education with
      special reference to health promotion practice in physical therapy: a
      multi-institutional international study.
PG  - 645-57
LID - 10.1007/s10459-012-9404-x [doi]
AB  - Health promotion (HP) warrants being a clinical competency for health
      professionals given the global burden of lifestyle-related conditions; these are 
      largely preventable with lifestyle behavior change. Physical therapists have a
      practice pattern conducive to HP, including lifestyle behavior change. The extent
      to which HP content is included in entry-level physical therapy (PT) curricula,
      and how it is taught however, is unknown. The aim of this study was to benchmark 
      lifestyle behavior HP content within entry-level curricula of international PT
      programs. The sampling frame included 258 accredited PT academic programs
      spanning six countries. An internet-based survey was used to assess HP curricular
      content. Descriptive questions for HP topics (smoking cessation, nutrition,
      weight control, alcohol consumption, exercise, and stress management) included
      hours allotted and instructional methods used. Chi square tests examined
      differences between the proportion of programs in the United States (US) and
      other countries (combined) for HP topics, and among HP topics regarding
      instructional methods. The response rate was 48 %. Most programs (>80 %) included
      all HP topics except alcohol consumption (65.5 % of programs). Instructional
      methods used were primarily theory-based; few programs (range 2.6-24.1 %)
      combined theory, practical and attainment of clinical competency for all HP
      topics (exercise prescription notwithstanding). Proportionally, more US programs 
      included alcohol and nutrition than other countries combined. Overall, HP
      lifestyle behavior topics were included to varying extent; however, instructional
      methods used and hours allotted per topic varied across PT curricula. Universal
      standards of HP practice as a clinical competency are warranted within the
      profession.

TI  - Motivational interviewing for improving outcomes in youth living with HIV.
PG  - CD009748
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009748.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Almost half of all the new HIV infections occur in youth.
      Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counselling technique that is effective in
      bringing about positive behavior changes in the general population. It is unclear
      whether it can be used to improve outcomes in youth living with HIV. OBJECTIVES: 
      To determine whether MI is effective in improving outcomes in youth living with
      HIV. SEARCH METHODS: We used a comprehensive and exhaustive strategy in an
      attempt to identify all relevant studies, regardless of language or publication
      status, in electronic databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of
      Controlled Trials, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, PsycINFO), conference proceedings and 
      specialised databases from January 1980 to March 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA:
      Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which youth (aged 10 to 24) living with
      HIV received MI, singly or in combination with another intervention compared to
      any other intervention, and reporting on the outcomes of interest (adherence to
      medication, mortality, quality of life, viral load, CD4-positive-T-lymphocyte
      count, progression to AIDS, retention in care, substance abuse and condom use).
      All settings were considered. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified 863
      references.Two authors independently examined the titles and abstracts of all
      identified trials, of which 28 full-text articles were closely screened for
      eligibility based on criteria established a-priori. The included studies were
      appraised for quality in duplicate. Data were extracted using a pre-tested and
      standardised form. No meta-analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials
      located in the United States, reported in four papers met our inclusion criteria.
      They enrolled a total of 237 participants and compared motivational interviewing 
      singly to standard of care. None of these trials reported on adherence to HIV
      medication, mortality or quality of life. Both trials reported reductions in
      viral load (in the short term) and unprotected sexual acts. A reduction in
      alcohol use was identified only in one of two studies that reported on this
      outcome. One trial reported on retention. Retention rates were not affected by
      the intervention. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is moderate quality evidence,
      coming from two trials which suggests that MI is effective in reducing short term
      viral load and unprotected sexual acts. There is moderate quality evidence from
      one trial that MI is effective in reducing alcohol use. There is a need for more 
      trials which report on outcomes such as adherence to medication, mortality and
      quality of life in youth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence rates during
      pregnancy and postpartum in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries.
      DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCI Web of
      Science, NLM Gateway, and Google scholar databases were searched. We included all
      studies reporting adherence rates as a primary or secondary outcome among
      HIV-infected pregnant women. Two independent reviewers extracted data on
      adherence and study characteristics. A random-effects model was used to pool
      adherence rates; sensitivity, heterogeneity, and publication bias were assessed. 
      RESULTS: Of 72 eligible articles, 51 studies involving 20 153 HIV-infected
      pregnant women were included. Most studies were from United States (n = 14, 27%) 
      followed by Kenya (n = 6, 12%), South Africa (n = 5, 10%), and Zambia (n = 5,
      10%). The threshold defining good adherence to ART varied across studies (>80,
      >90, >95, 100%). A pooled analysis of all studies indicated a pooled estimate of 
      73.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 69.3-77.5%] of pregnant women who had
      adequate (>80%) ART adherence. The pooled proportion of women with adequate
      adherence levels was higher during the antepartum (75.7%, 95% CI 71.5-79.7%) than
      during postpartum (53.0%, 95% CI 32.8-72.7%; P = 0.005). Selected reported
      barriers for nonadherence included physical, economic and emotional stresses,
      depression (especially postdelivery), alcohol or drug use, and ART dosing
      frequency or pill burden. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that only 73.5% of
      pregnant women achieved optimal ART adherence. Reaching adequate ART adherence
      levels was a challenge in pregnancy, but especially during the postpartum period.
      Further research to investigate specific barriers and interventions to address
      them is urgently needed globally.

      Native women who are pregnant or of reproductive age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are the leading preventable 
      cause of developmental disabilities in the United States and likely throughout
      the world. FASDs can be prevented by avoiding alcohol use during pregnancy;
      however, efforts to prevent risky alcohol consumption in women of childbearing
      potential have not been universally successful. OBJECTIVES: Data suggest that
      successful interventions may require tailoring methods to meet the needs of
      specific populations and cultures. Key findings of interventions previously
      tested among American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) women who are or may
      become pregnant, data gaps, and promising ongoing interventions are reviewed.
      METHODS: A systematic review of the current literature on empirically based
      interventions among AI/AN women was conducted. Selected alternative approaches
      currently being tested in AI/AN settings are also described. RESULTS: Similar to 
      findings among other populations of women in the United States, a number of
      interventions have been implemented; however, only a small number have measured
      results. Approaches have included standard interventions involving
      hospitalization, inpatient, or outpatient care; wellness education; traditional
      approaches; and case management for high-risk women. An ongoing Screening, Brief 
      Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) protocol comparing the
      effectiveness of a web-based culturally adapted tool, or a peer health educator
      model to standard clinical practice is described. CONCLUSION: Translation of
      successful interventions from other settings to AI/AN populations holds promise. 
      SCIENTIFIC SIGNIFICANCE: FASDs represent a significant health issue with high
      personal and societal costs. Improvement of interventions to prevent prenatal
      alcohol consumption in specific populations, including AI/AN women, is a critical
      public health need.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of an interactive mobile
      messaging intervention for underserved smokers: Project ACTION.
PG  - 696
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-12-696 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite a significant decrease in smoking prevalence over the past
      ten years, cigarette smoking still represents the leading cause of preventable
      morbidity and mortality in the United States. Moreover, smoking prevalence is
      significantly higher among those with low levels of education and those living
      at, or below, the poverty level. These groups tend to be confronted with
      significant barriers to utilizing more traditional smoking cessation intervention
      approaches. The purpose of the study, Project ACTION (Adult smoking Cessation
      Treatment through Innovative Outreach to Neighborhoods), is to utilize a mobile
      clinic model, a network of community sites (i.e., community centers and churches)
      and an interactive mobile messaging system to reach and deliver smoking cessation
      treatment to underserved, low-income communities. METHODS/DESIGN: We are using a 
      group-randomized design, with the community site as the sampling unit, to compare
      the efficacy of three smoking cessation interventions: 1) Standard Care--brief
      advice to quit smoking, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and self-help
      materials; 2) Enhanced Care--standard care components plus a cell phone-delivered
      text/graphical messaging component; and 3) Intensive Care--enhanced care
      components plus a series of 11 cell phone-delivered proactive counseling
      sessions. An economic evaluation will also be performed to evaluate the relative 
      cost effectiveness of the three treatment approaches. We will recruit 756
      participants (252 participants in each of the 3 intervention groups). At the time
      of randomization, participants complete a baseline assessment, consisting of
      smoking history, socio-demographic, and psychosocial variables. Monthly cell
      phone assessments are conducted for 6 months-post enrollment, and a final
      12-month follow-up is conducted at the original neighborhood site of enrollment. 
      We will perform mixed-model logistic regression to compare the efficacy of the
      three smoking cessation intervention treatment groups. DISCUSSION: It is
      hypothesized that the intensive care approach will most successfully address the 
      needs of the target population and result in the highest smoking cessation rates.
      In addition to increasing cessation rates, the intervention offers several
      features (including neighborhood outreach and use of mHealth technology) that are
      likely to reduce treatment barriers while enhancing participant engagement and
      retention to treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This randomized controlled trial is
      registered with clinicaltrials.gov registration number NCT00948129.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus testing of persons born during 1945-1965: recommendations from 
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
PG  - 817-22
AB  - DESCRIPTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a group of 
      governmental and private sector partners developed these evidence-based
      recommendations to increase the proportion of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected
      persons who know their status and are linked to appropriate care and treatment.
      The recommendations also address brief alcohol screening, as alcohol accelerates 
      progression of liver disease among HCV-infected individuals. These
      recommendations augment CDC's 1998 and 1999 recommendations based on risk and
      medical indications and are not meant to replace those recommendations. METHODS: 
      These recommendations are based on systematic reviews of evidence published from 
      1995 through February 2012 in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central
      Register of Controlled Trials, Sociological Abstracts, and Database of Abstracts 
      of Reviews of Effects. Selected studies included cross-sectional and cohort
      studies that addressed either prevalence of hepatitis C in the United States or
      clinical outcomes (for example, hepatocellular carcinoma and serious adverse
      events) among treated patients and systematic reviews of trials that assessed
      effectiveness of brief screening interventions for alcohol consumption. The
      Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework was 
      used to assess quality of the evidence. RECOMMENDATION 1: Adults born during
      1945-1965 should receive 1-time testing for HCV without prior ascertainment of
      HCV risk. (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).
      RECOMMENDATION 2: All persons with identified HCV infection should receive a
      brief alcohol screening and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by
      referral to appropriate care and treatment services for HCV infection and related
      conditions (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).

TI  - Recommendations for the identification of chronic hepatitis C virus infection
      among persons born during 1945-1965.
PG  - 1-32
AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an increasing cause of morbidity and mortality in the 
      United States. Many of the 2.7-3.9 million persons living with HCV infection are 
      unaware they are infected and do not receive care (e.g., education, counseling,
      and medical monitoring) and treatment. CDC estimates that although persons born
      during 1945-1965 comprise an estimated 27% of the population, they account for
      approximately three fourths of all HCV infections in the United States, 73% of
      HCV-associated mortality, and are at greatest risk for hepatocellular carcinoma
      and other HCV-related liver disease. With the advent of new therapies that can
      halt disease progression and provide a virologic cure (i.e., sustained viral
      clearance following completion of treatment) in most persons, targeted testing
      and linkage to care for infected persons in this birth cohort is expected to
      reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. CDC is augmenting previous
      recommendations for HCV testing (CDC. Recommendations for prevention and control 
      of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease. MMWR
      1998;47[No. RR-19]) to recommend one-time testing without prior ascertainment of 
      HCV risk for persons born during 1945-1965, a population with a
      disproportionately high prevalence of HCV infection and related disease. Persons 
      identified as having HCV infection should receive a brief screening for alcohol
      use and intervention as clinically indicated, followed by referral to appropriate
      care for HCV infection and related conditions. These recommendations do not
      replace previous guidelines for HCV testing that are based on known risk factors 
      and clinical indications. Rather, they define an additional target population for
      testing: persons born during 1945-1965. CDC developed these recommendations with 
      the assistance of a work group representing diverse expertise and perspectives.
      The recommendations are informed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
      Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework, an approach that provides guidance
      and tools to define the research questions, conduct the systematic review, assess
      the overall quality of the evidence, and determine strength of the
      recommendations. This report is intended to serve as a resource for health-care
      professionals, public health officials, and organizations involved in the
      development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention and clinical services. 
      These recommendations will be reviewed every 5 years and updated to include
      advances in the published evidence.

      cessation counseling provided in the hospital is effective, but only if it
      continues for more than one month after discharge. Providing smoking cessation
      medication at discharge may add benefit to counseling. A major barrier to
      translating this research into clinical practice is sustaining treatment during
      the transition to outpatient care. An evidence-based, practical, cost-effective
      model that facilitates the continuation of tobacco treatment after discharge is
      needed. This paper describes the design of a comparative effectiveness trial
      testing a hospital-initiated intervention against standard care. METHODS/DESIGN: 
      A two-arm randomized controlled trial compares the effectiveness of standard
      post-discharge care with a multi-component smoking cessation intervention
      provided for three months after discharge. Current smokers admitted to
      Massachusetts General Hospital who receive bedside smoking cessation counseling, 
      intend to quit after discharge and are willing to consider smoking cessation
      medication are eligible. Study participants are recruited following the hospital 
      counseling visit and randomly assigned to receive Standard Care or Extended Care 
      after hospital discharge. Standard Care includes a recommendation for a smoking
      cessation medication and information about community resources. Extended Care
      includes up to three months of free FDA-approved smoking cessation medication and
      five proactive computerized telephone calls that use interactive voice response
      technology to provide tailored motivational messages, offer additional live
      telephone counseling calls from a smoking cessation counselor, and facilitate
      medication refills. Outcomes are assessed at one, three, and six months after
      hospital discharge. The primary outcomes are self-reported and validated
      seven-day point prevalence tobacco abstinence at six months. Other outcomes
      include short-term and sustained smoking cessation, post-discharge utilization of
      smoking cessation treatment, hospital readmissions and emergency room visits, and
      program cost per quit. DISCUSSION: This study tests a disseminable smoking
      intervention model for hospitalized smokers. If effective and widely adopted, it 
      could help to reduce population smoking rates and thereby reduce tobacco-related 
      mortality, morbidity, and health care costs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: United States

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations between cigarette smoking, alcohol
      intake, and thyroid cancer risk in a pooled analysis of five prospective studies.
      METHODS: Data from five prospective U.S. studies were standardized and then
      combined into one aggregate dataset (384,433 men and 361,664 women). Pooled
      hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for thyroid cancer were
      estimated from mutually adjusted models of cigarette smoking and alcohol intake, 
      which were additionally adjusted for age, sex, education, race, marital status,
      body mass index, and cohort. RESULTS: Over follow-up, 1,003 incident thyroid
      cancer cases (335 men and 668 women) were identified. Compared to never smokers, 
      current smoking was associated with reduced risk of thyroid cancer (HR = 0.68, 95
      % CI 0.55-0.85); this association was slightly stronger among non-drinkers (HR = 
      0.46, 95 % CI 0.29-0.74). No reduction in risk was observed for former, compared 
      to never, smokers. Greater smoking intensity, duration, and pack-years were
      associated with further reductions in risk among former and current smokers.
      Alcohol intake was also inversely associated with thyroid cancer risk (>/=7
      drinks/week versus 0, HR = 0.72, 95 % CI 0.58-0.90, p trend = 0.002). Inverse
      associations with smoking and alcohol were more pronounced for papillary versus
      follicular tumors. CONCLUSION: The results of this pooled analysis suggest that
      both cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with reduced risks 
      of papillary thyroid cancer and, possibly, follicular thyroid cancer.

      pooling project.
PG  - 1729-37
LID - 10.1007/s10552-012-9959-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding how sex and tobacco exposure may modify lifetime risks 
      for cancer mortality is important for effective communication of risk in targeted
      public health messages. OBJECTIVE: To determine lifetime risk estimates for
      cancer death associated with sex and smoking status in the United States.
      METHODS: A pooled cohort design using ten well-defined epidemiologic cohorts
      including middle-aged and older individuals was used to estimate the lifetime
      risk for cancer death at selected index ages, with death from non-cancer causes
      as the competing risk, by sex and smoking status. RESULTS: There were a total of 
      11,317 cancer-related deaths. At age 45 years, the lifetime risk of cancer death 
      for male smokers is 27.7 % (95 % CI 24.0-31.4 %) compared to 15.8 % (95 % CI
      12.7-18.9 %) for male non-smokers. At age 45 years, the lifetime risk of cancer
      death for female smokers is 21.7 % (95 % CI 18.8-24.6 %) compared to 13.2 % (95 %
      CI 11.0-15.4 %) for female non-smokers. Remaining lifetime risk for cancer death 
      declined with age, and men have a greater risk for cancer death compared to
      women. Adjustment for competing risk of death, particularly representing
      cardiovascular mortality, yielded a greater change in lifetime risk estimates for
      men and smokers compared to women and non-smokers. CONCLUSIONS: At the population
      level, the lifetime risk for cancer death remains significantly higher for
      smokers compared to non-smokers, regardless of sex. These estimates may provide
      clinicians with useful information for counseling individual patients and
      highlight the need for continued public health efforts related to smoking
      cessation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify a potential core set of brief screeners 
      for the detection of individuals with a substance use disorder (SUD) in medical
      settings. METHOD: Data were from two multisite studies that evaluated stimulant
      use outcomes of an abstinence-based contingency management intervention as an
      addition to usual care (National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network
      trials 006-007). The sample comprised 847 substance-using adults who were
      recruited from 12 outpatient substance abuse treatment settings across the United
      States. Alcohol and drug use disorders were assessed by the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Checklist. Data were
      analyzed by factor analysis, item response theory (IRT), sensitivity and
      specificity procedures. RESULTS: Comparatively prevalent symptoms of dependence, 
      especially inability to cut down for all substances, showed high sensitivity for 
      detecting an SUD (low rate of false negative). IRT-defined severe (infrequent)
      and low discriminative items, especially withdrawal for alcohol, cannabis and
      cocaine, had low sensitivity in identifying cases of an SUD. IRT-defined less
      severe (frequent) and high discriminative items, including inability to cut down 
      or taking larger amounts than intended for all substances and withdrawal for
      amphetamines and opioids, showed good-to-high values of area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve in classifying cases and noncases of an SUD.
      CONCLUSION: Findings suggest the feasibility of identifying psychometrically
      reliable substance dependence symptoms to develop a two-item screen for alcohol
      and drug disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) abuse is a worldwide problem. Little is known
      about the co-morbidity of substance use disorders (SUD) and other psychiatric
      disorders of mothers who use MA prenatally. The Infant Development, Environment
      and Lifestyle (IDEAL) Study is a prospective, investigation of prenatal MA use
      and child outcome in the United States (US) and New Zealand (NZ). This study
      examined prenatal MA use and the co-morbidity of SUD and psychiatric disorders at
      1-month postpartum. METHOD: Mothers who used MA (US=127, NZ=97) were compared to 
      a matched comparison group (US=193, NZ=110). The Substance Abuse Subtle Screening
      Inventory-3 was used to measure the probability of a SUD. The Brief Symptom
      Inventory (BSI) was used to measure the likelihood of a positive diagnosis of a
      psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: In the US and NZ, MA groups had lower SES,
      increased single parenting, delayed prenatal care, and increased polydrug use. In
      the US only, MA mothers had lower income than the comparison group. MA users were
      10 times more likely to have a SUD and twice as likely to meet BSI criteria for a
      diagnosable psychiatric disorder. In NZ, but not the US, MA users were five times
      more likely to have co-morbidity of both. This disparity may be due to higher
      quantities of prenatal alcohol use associated with increased psychiatric
      symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that addressing both substance abuse
      and psychiatric disorders in mothers who use MA may be required to effectively
      treat maternal MA use.

TI  - Sequence of alcohol involvement from early onset to young adult alcohol abuse:
      differential predictors and moderation by family-focused preventive intervention.
PG  - 2137-48

AB  - AIMS: This study tests risk factors for four dimensions of alcohol use in the
      sequence from (i) early onset prior to age 13 to (ii) adolescent alcohol use and 
      (iii) alcohol problems to (iv) young adult alcohol abuse. It also examines
      whether family-focused preventive interventions buffer predictive relationships. 
      DESIGN: Data were from a randomized prevention trial extending from ages 11 to 21
      years. SETTING: Families of sixth graders enrolled in 33 rural schools in the
      Midwestern United States were invited to participate. PARTICIPANTS: Families (n =
      667) were pretested and assigned randomly to a control group (n = 208) or to
      family interventions (n = 459). The average age of participating youth was 11.3
      years when the study began (52% female). MEASUREMENTS: Questionnaire data were
      collected on alcohol dimensions during adolescence (early onset, alcohol use,
      alcohol problems) and young adulthood (alcohol abuse), and on risk factors in
      early adolescence (male gender, impulsive behaviors, aggression-hostility, peer
      deviance and parent problem drinking). FINDINGS: Impulsive behaviors predicted
      early onset, peer deviance predicted alcohol use and parent problem drinking
      predicted alcohol problems (P < 0.05). Aggression-hostility and alcohol problems 
      predicted alcohol abuse in the control group (P < 0.05), but not in the family
      interventions group (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different dimensions of alcohol use 
      and problems from before age 13 to young adulthood are predicted by different
      risk factors. Family-focused preventive interventions can reduce the influence of
      some of these risk factors, including early adolescent aggression-hostility and
      late adolescent alcohol problems.

BTI - Screening Women for Intimate Partner Violence and Elderly and Vulnerable Adults
      for Abuse: Systematic Review to Update the 2004 U.S. Preventive Services Task
      Force Recommendation
AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) and abuse of elders and vulnerable persons is
      common in the United States and often undetected. Screening individuals without
      obvious signs of abuse in health care settings could identify those at risk and
      lead to interventions that reduce exposure to violence and abuse and improve
      health outcomes. To update the previous 2004 evidence report on screening for IPV
      and abuse of elders and vulnerable persons for the U.S. Preventive Services Task 
      Force (USPSTF). We reviewed the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
      and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews through the fourth quarter of 2011,
      and MEDLINE and PsycINFO from 2002 to January 9, 2012, for relevant
      English-language studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses. Reference lists 
      of papers and citations of key studies were reviewed manually and by using
      Scopus. The screening population included adults who have no obvious signs or
      symptoms of abuse who interact with health care providers in a number of health
      care settings. Studies were selected based on preestablished selection criteria
      using randomized, controlled trials to determine the effectiveness of screening
      and interventions to reduce abuse and improve health outcomes; studies of
      diagnostic accuracy to evaluate the ability of screening instruments to identify 
      abused individuals; and studies of any design to determine harms of screening and
      interventions. For studies of screening and interventions, information about the 
      patient populations, study designs, screening methods, types of interventions,
      followup, methods of analysis, and results were abstracted. For studies of
      screening instruments, details about the study designs, instruments, reference
      standards, populations, methods of administration, and results were abstracted.
      Predefined criteria developed by the USPSTF were used to rate the quality of
      studies as good, fair, or poor. For IPV, a randomized, controlled trial comparing
      IPV screening versus no screening in Canadian health care settings indicated that
      both groups had reductions in IPV recurrence, post-traumatic stress disorder
      symptoms, and alcohol problems, as well as improvements in scores for quality of 
      life, depression, and mental health after 18 months of followup; however,
      differences between groups were not statistically significant for these outcomes.
      Six instruments with 1 to 8 items demonstrated sensitivity and specificity >80
      percent in clinical populations of asymptomatic women; results varied between
      studies and across instruments. A trial of pregnant women reported decreased
      violence and improved birth outcomes with counseling versus usual care. Two
      trials of home visitation versus no visitation for young mothers resulted in
      improved outcomes with visitation. Counseling resulted in decreased pregnancy
      coercion and resolution of unsafe relationships versus usual care in one trial.
      Two trials of counseling showed improved outcomes in intervention and control
      groups without differences between them (counseling vs. referral cards, nurse
      management vs. usual care in pregnancy). For abuse of elder and vulnerable
      adults, few studies met inclusion criteria. A descriptive study of elderly abused
      veterans who were identified in primary care clinics and referred to case
      management found that 5 percent were reported to Adult Protective Services and 6 
      percent required nursing home placement or conservatorship arrangements. A single
      instrument, the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index, was evaluated for diagnostic
      accuracy and had sensitivity and specificity of 9 to 47 percent and 75 to 97
      percent, respectively, depending on the number of positive responses to specific 
      questions. Studies of IPV were limited by heterogeneity, lack of true control
      groups, high and/or differential loss to followup, self-reported measures,
      inadequate power, recall bias, missing data, Hawthorne effect among control
      participants, and reference standards that were not credible or replicable in
      diagnostic accuracy studies. Studies of elder and vulnerable adult abuse were
      lacking. A trial of screening showed reductions in IPV recurrence and improvement
      in related outcomes for both screening and comparison groups, but interpretations
      are limited by high attrition and the Hawthorne effect. Trials of IPV
      interventions for pregnant women and young mothers showed improved outcomes for
      the intervention versus usual care groups. Several instruments have been
      developed for IPV screening; six instruments with 1 to 8 items demonstrated
      sensitivity and specificity >80 percent in clinical populations of asymptomatic
      women, although results varied between studies and across instruments. Studies
      were lacking to address screening elderly and vulnerable adults for abuse.

TI  - Behavior change counseling curricula for medical trainees: a systematic review.
PG  - 956-68
LID - 10.1097/ACM.0b013e31825837be [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Unhealthy behaviors contribute to half of U.S. deaths. However,
      physicians lack sufficient skill in counseling patients to change behaviors.
      Characterizing effective published curricular interventions for behavior change
      counseling for medical trainees would inform educators toward improved training. 
      METHOD: The authors conducted a systematic literature search of studies published
      between 1965 and 2011 evaluating curricula on behavior change counseling for
      medical trainees. Included studies described behavior change counseling, teaching
      interventions for medical trainees, and assessment of interventions. The authors 
      extracted eligible articles, rated outcomes for learners and patients using
      Kirkpatrick's hierarchy, and determined study quality. RESULTS: Of 2,788
      identified citations, 109 met inclusion criteria. Most studies were performed in 
      the United States (98), 93 at a single institution, and 81 in primary care
      settings. Curricular topics for counseling included smoking (67 studies),
      nutrition (30), alcohol/drug use (26), and exercise (22). Although most studies
      did not include theoretical frameworks, 39 used the Transtheoretical Model of
      Change. Sixty-two studies involved eight or fewer hours of curricular time, and
      51 spanned four or fewer weeks. The studies with highest-level outcomes and
      quality employed multiple curricular techniques and included practice of
      counseling techniques in either simulated or actual clinical settings.
      CONCLUSIONS: Existing literature suggests that trainees learn behavior change
      counseling through active, realistic practice and implementation of reminder and 
      feedback systems within actual clinical practice settings. Multiinstitutional
      medical education research on methods of teaching behavior change counseling that
      influence patients' health outcomes are needed to ensure trainees' clinical
      competence and improve patient care.

TI  - Results of a transtheoretical model-based alcohol, tobacco and other drug
      intervention in middle schools.
PG  - 1009-18
LID - 10.1016/j.addbeh.2012.04.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs threatens the physical
      and mental well-being of students and continued use negatively affects many areas
      of development. An internet-based, tailored intervention based on the
      Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change was delivered to middle school students
      to reduce alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. This internet-based approach
      requires very little faculty and staff time, which is efficient given curricular 
      demands. METHODS: Twenty-two middle schools in the United States were matched and
      randomly assigned to either the intervention or control conditions (N=1590
      students who had ever used substances). Participants received one pre-test
      assessment, three thirty-minute intervention sessions over three months, and two 
      post-test assessments (3 and 14 months after pre-test, respectively). RESULTS:
      Random effects logistic models showed significant treatment effects for the
      intervention group when compared to the control group at the 3-month post-test.
      CONCLUSIONS: This program has the potential to be applied as stand-alone practice
      or as part of more intensive interventions to promote substance use cessation.

TI  - Effectiveness of brief interventions as part of the screening, brief intervention
      and referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for reducing the non-medical use of
      psychoactive substances: a systematic review protocol.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-1-22 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a significant public health burden associated with substance
      use in Canada. The early detection and/or treatment of risky substance use has
      the potential to dramatically improve outcomes for those who experience harms
      from the non-medical use of psychoactive substances, particularly adolescents
      whose brains are still undergoing development. The Screening, Brief Intervention,
      and Referral to Treatment model is a comprehensive, integrated approach for the
      delivery of early intervention and treatment services for individuals
      experiencing substance use-related harms, as well as those who are at risk of
      experiencing such harm. METHODS: This article describes the protocol for a
      systematic review of the effectiveness of brief interventions as part of the
      Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment model for reducing the
      non-medical use of psychoactive substances. Studies will be selected in which
      brief interventions target non-medical psychoactive substance use (excluding
      alcohol, nicotine, or caffeine) among those 12 years and older who are
      opportunistically screened and deemed at risk of harms related to psychoactive
      substance use. We will include one-on-one verbal interventions and exclude
      non-verbal brief interventions (for example, the provision of information such as
      a pamphlet or online interventions) and group interventions. Primary, secondary
      and adverse outcomes of interest are prespecified. Randomized controlled trials
      will be included; non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-after
      studies and interrupted time series designs will be considered in the absence of 
      randomized controlled trials. We will search several bibliographic databases (for
      example, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, CORK) and search sources for grey
      literature. We will meta-analyze studies where possible. We will conduct subgroup
      analyses, if possible, according to drug class and intervention setting.
      DISCUSSION: This review will provide evidence on the effectiveness of brief
      interventions as part of the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to
      Treatment protocol aimed at the non-medical use of psychoactive substances and
      may provide guidance as to where future research might be most beneficial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent research indicates that 35 percent of blue-collar workers in
      the US currently smoke while only 20 percent of white-collar workers smoke. Over 
      the last year, we have been working with heavy equipment operators, specifically 
      the Local 324 Training Center of the International Union of Operating Engineers, 
      to study the epidemiology of smoking, which is 29% compared to 21% among the
      general population. For the current study funded by the National Cancer Institute
      (1R21CA152247-01A1), we have developed the Tobacco Tactics website which will be 
      compared to the state supported 1-800-QUIT-NOW telephone line. Outcome evaluation
      will compare those randomized to the Tobacco Tactics web-based intervention to
      those randomized to the 1-800-QUIT-NOW control condition on: a) 30-day and
      6-month quit rates; b) cotinine levels; c) cigarettes smoked/day; d) number of
      quit attempts; and e) nicotine addiction. Process evaluation will compare the two
      groups on the: a) contacts with intervention; b) medications used; c) helpfulness
      of the nurse/coach; and d) willingness to recommend the intervention to others.
      METHODS/DESIGN: This will be a randomized controlled trial (N = 184). Both
      interventions will be offered during regularly scheduled safety training at Local
      324 Training Center of the International Union of Operating Engineers and both
      will include optional provision of over-the-counter nicotine replacement therapy 
      and the same number of telephone contacts. However, the Tobacco Tactics website
      has graphics tailored to Operating Engineers, tailored cessation feedback from
      the website, and follow up nurse counseling offered by multimedia options
      including phone and/or email, and/or e-community. Primary Analysis of Aim 1 will 
      be conducted by using logistic regression to compare smoking habits (e.g., quit
      rates) of those in the intervention arm to those in the control arm. Primary
      analyses for Aim 2 will compare process measures (e.g., medications used) between
      the two groups by linear, logistic, and Poisson regression. DISCUSSION:
      Dissemination of an efficacious work-site, web-based smoking cessation
      intervention has the potential to substantially impact cancer rates among this
      population. Based on the outcome of this smaller study, wider scale testing in
      conjunction with the International Environment Technology Testing Center which
      services Operating Engineers across North America (including US, Mexico, and
      Canada) will be conducted. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT01124110.

TI  - National prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder among sexually revictimized 
      adolescent, college, and adult household-residing women.
PG  - 935-42
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite empirical links between sexual revictimization (ie, experiencing
      2 or more sexual assaults) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), to our
      knowledge, no epidemiological studies document the prevalence of sexual
      revictimization and PTSD. Establishing estimates is essential to determine the
      scope, public health impact, and psychiatric sequelae of sexual revictimization. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of sexual revictimization and PTSD among 3 
      national female samples (adolescent, college, and adult household probability).
      DESIGN: Surveys were used to collect data from the National Women's
      Study-Replication (2006; college) as well as household probability samples from
      the National Survey of Adolescents-Replication (2005) and the National Women's
      Study-Replication (2006; household probability). SETTING: Households and college 
      campuses across the United States. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred
      sixty-three adolescent girls, 2000 college women, and 3001 household-residing
      adult women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Behaviorally specific questions assessed
      unwanted sexual acts occurring over the life span owing to the use of force,
      threat of force, or incapacitation via drug or alcohol use. Posttraumatic stress 
      disorder was assessed with a module validated against the criterion standard
      Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. RESULTS: About 53% of victimized
      adolescents, 50% of victimized college women, and 58.8% of victimized
      household-residing women reported sexual revictimization. Current PTSD was
      reported by 20% of revictimized adolescents, 40% of revictimized college women,
      and 27.2% of revictimized household-residing women. Compared with nonvictims,
      odds of meeting past 6-month PTSD were 4.3 to 8.2 times higher for revictimized
      respondents and 2.4 to 3.5 times higher for single victims. CONCLUSIONS:
      Population prevalence estimates suggest that 769 000 adolescent girls, 625 000
      college women, and 13.4 million women in US households reported sexual
      revictimization. Further, 154 000 sexually revictimized adolescents, 250 000
      sexually revictimized college women, and 3.6 million sexually revictimized
      household women met criteria for past 6-month PTSD. Findings highlight the
      importance of screening for sexual revictimization and PTSD in pediatric,
      college, and primary care settings.

TI  - Long-term follow-up after voluntary human immunodeficiency virus/sexually
      transmitted infection counseling, point-of-service testing, and referral to
      substance abuse treatment from the emergency department.
PG  - 386-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1553-2712.2012.01314.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Public health initiatives have lowered human immunodeficiency virus
      (HIV) transmission risk associated with injection drug use in the United States, 
      making sexual risk behaviors a greater source of transmission. Strategies are
      therefore needed to reduce these risk behaviors among all emergency department
      (ED) patients who use drugs, regardless of route of administration. Although
      recent articles have focused on the opportunity for early HIV detection and
      treatment through an array of ED screening and testing strategies, the effect of 
      voluntary HIV testing and brief counseling (VT/C) on the sexual behaviors of
      out-of-treatment drug users over time has not yet been reported. METHODS: From
      November 2004 to May 2008, the study screened 46,208 urban ED patients aged 18 to
      54 years; 2,148 (4.6%) reported cocaine or heroin use within 30 days, 1,538 met
      eligibility criteria (Drug Abuse Severity Test [DAST] scores >/=3 and were either
      English- or Spanish-speaking), and 1,030 were enrolled. These data were obtained 
      in the course of a randomized, controlled trial (Project SAFE) of a brief
      motivational intervention focused on reducing risky sexual behaviors. Although
      the intervention itself did not demonstrate any differential effect on the number
      or percentage of unprotected sexual acts, both control and intervention group
      participants received baseline VT/C and referral for drug treatment as part of
      the study protocol. This study is a report of a secondary analysis of cohort data
      to describe changes in sexual behaviors over time among drug users after the VT/C
      and referral. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) age of enrollees was 35.8 (+/-8.4) years;
      67% were male, 39% were non-Hispanic black or African American, 41% were white
      non-Hispanic, and 19% were Hispanic. Half injected drugs, and 53% met criteria
      for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). At baseline testing, 8.8% were
      HIV-positive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Follow-ups were conducted at 6
      and 12 months, with an attrition rate of 22%. Known HIV-positive patients
      accounted for 84 of 1,030 cases (8.1%), and 13 new cases were discovered: 7 of
      946 at were discovered at the baseline contact (0.74%), 2 of 655 were discovered 
      at 6 months (0.3%), and 4 of 706 (0.57%) were discovered at the 12-month contact.
      Twelve of the 13 returned for confirmatory testing and were actively enrolled in 
      our infectious disease clinic. For all partners, there was a reduction in the
      percentage of unprotected sex acts over time (p < 0.0001), with decreases at 6
      months versus baseline (odds ratio [OR] = 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
      0.60 to 0.83), sustained at 12 months versus baseline (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.58
      to 0.82). For the outcome of percentage of sex acts while high, there was also a 
      significant reduction over time (p < 0.0001), with a drop-off at 6 months versus 
      baseline (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.37) that was sustained at 12 months (OR
      vs. baseline 0.25, 95% CI = 0.20 to 0.30). In an adjusted model, male sex, older 
      age, and HIV positivity predicted significant declines over time in the
      likelihood of unprotected sexual acts. Older age and higher baseline drug
      severity predicted significant decreases over time in the likelihood of sex acts 
      while high. CONCLUSIONS: Voluntary testing and counseling for HIV or sexually
      transmitted infections, accompanied by referral to drug treatment, for this
      population of ED cocaine and heroin users was associated with reduction in
      unprotected sex acts and fewer sex acts while high.

TI  - Reach and effectiveness of mailed nicotine replacement therapy for smokers:
      6-month outcomes in a naturalistic exploratory study.
PG  - e4
LID - 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2011-050303 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are important inequities in smoker access to clinic-based
      smoking cessation services. Low barrier high-reach interventions are proposed as 
      solutions to these inequities. Although effective, telephone quitlines, which
      provide multi-session counselling but no medication, have low utilization with
      high attrition. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of
      free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), brief advice and self-help materials on 
      quit attempts and 6-month quit rates in motivated smokers. METHODS: In this
      open-label naturalistic study, 14,000 treatments of 5 weeks in duration of either
      nicotine patch (n=10,000) or nicotine gum (n=4000) were made available to all
      eligible adult smokers in Ontario, Canada, who called a toll-free number to
      register with the STOP (Smoking Treatment for Ontario Patients) Study and receive
      a single brief intervention. The primary outcome measure was self-reported
      abstinence rates at 6 months post-treatment among STOP participants. These data
      were compared with quit rates that were reported in a concurrent no-intervention 
      cohort of Ontario smokers matched for eligibility. RESULTS: 16 405 callers were
      assessed and 13143 eligible participants were mailed a treatment package with 5
      weeks of NRT (choice of patch or gum), self-help and community resource
      materials. Among the 6261 participants who consented to follow-up, 2601 (42%) had
      complete follow-up data. Of those with complete follow-up data, the percentage
      reporting abstinence after 6 months in the treatment cohort was 21.4%, relative
      to 11.6% in the no-intervention cohort (rate ratio of 1.84; 95% CI 1.79 to 1.89),
      with the 30-day point prevalence of 17.8% and 9.8% for the intervention and
      no-intervention cohorts, respectively (rate ratio 1.81; CI 1.75 to 1.87).
      CONCLUSIONS: Provision of free NRT by mail following a brief telephone
      intervention is an effective strategy to reach and assist a large number of
      smokers making a quit attempt.

TI  - Tobacco dependence counseling in a randomized multisite clinical trial.
PG  - 576-82
LID - 10.1016/j.cct.2012.02.014 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacotherapy trials for treating tobacco dependence would benefit from
      behavioral interventions providing treatment consistent with clinical practice
      guidelines but not directing participants to treatments not evaluated in the
      trial. The Smoke Free and Living It(c) behavioral intervention manual includes
      participant and interventionist guides and is designed to provide both practical 
      counseling and intra-treatment support. We utilized this intervention manual in a
      multicenter, randomized clinical trial of smokers with attention deficit
      hyperactivity disorder. In this study, we evaluated how the interventional manual
      performed in a "train-the-trainer" model requiring uniform counseling across 6
      sites and 15 interventionists. We analyzed the skill-adherence of the
      interventionists and the intervention-adherence of the participants. The 255
      randomized participants completed 9.3+/-2.8 sessions (mean+/-SD), with 157
      participants (61.6%) completing all 11 of the sessions and 221 (86.7%) completing
      at least 6 of the 11 sessions. Of the 163 sessions for which the study
      interventionists were evaluated, 156 (95.7%) were rated as adherent to protocol
      and "meeting expectations" on at least 6 of 7 established criteria, illustrating 
      that fidelity can be maintained with minimal supervision. The self-help and
      interventionists guides of the Smoke Free and Living It manual can thus be used
      to provide behavioral intervention with a high rate of adherence by both the
      interventionists and the participants. This manual meets the requirements of the 
      United States Public Health Service Clinical Practice Guideline, can be adapted
      to specific research protocols, and provides a useful option for behavioral
      intervention during clinical trials for smoking cessation.

TI  - Patient and hospital characteristics associated with traditional measures of
      inpatient quality of care for patients with heart failure.
PG  - 239-45.e3
LID - 10.1016/j.ahj.2011.10.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine patient and hospital
      characteristics associated with 4 measures of quality of inpatient heart failure 
      care used by both the primary payer of heart failure care in the United States
      (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and the main hospital accrediting
      organization (The Joint Commission). METHODS: We used data from Get With The
      Guidelines Program for patients hospitalized with heart failure. Eligibility for 
      receiving care based on the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services performance
      measures was determined for assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF; n = 60,601), use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or
      angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) if LVEF<40% and no contraindications
      (24,130), discharge instructions (49,383), and smoking cessation counseling
      (10,152). Patient and hospital characteristics that were significantly associated
      with performance measures in univariate analyses were entered into multivariate
      logistic regression models. RESULTS: Overall, documentation for LVEF assessment
      was noted in 95%, ACEi/ARB use in 87%, discharge instruction in 82%, and smoking 
      cessation counseling in 91% of eligible patients. In adjusted analyses, older
      patients and those with evidence of renal failure were significantly less likely 
      to receive each care measure except for discharge instructions (no age effect).
      Patients with higher body mass index were more likely to receive ACEi/ARB and
      discharge instructions but less likely to have LVEF documented or to receive
      smoking cessation counseling. Small hospitals (<200 beds) were less likely to
      provide each of the performance measures compared with larger hospitals.
      CONCLUSION: Recommended heart failure care is less likely in patients with
      certain characteristics (older age and abnormal renal function) and those cared
      for in smaller hospitals. Programs to improve evidence-based care for heart
      failure should consider interventions specifically targeting and tailored to
      smaller facilities and patients who are older with comorbidities.

TI  - Predictors of warfarin use in atrial fibrillation in the United States: a
      systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-13-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite warfarin's marked efficacy, not all eligible patients receive
      it for stroke prevention in AF. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the
      association between prescriber and/or patient characteristics and subsequent
      prescription of warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial
      fibrillation (AF). METHODS: Observational studies conducted in the US using
      multivariate analysis to determine the relationship between characteristics and
      the odds of receiving warfarin for stroke prevention were identified in MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE and a manual review of references. Effect estimates of prescriber and/or
      patient characteristics from individual studies were pooled to calculate odds
      ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies
      reporting results of 33 unique multivariate analyses were identified. Warfarin
      use across studies ranged from 9.1%-79.8% (median=49.1%). There was a
      moderately-strong correlation between warfarin use and year of study (r=0.60,
      p=0.002). Upon meta-analysis, characteristics associated with a statistically
      significant increase in the odds of warfarin use included history of
      cerebrovascular accident (OR=1.59), heart failure (OR=1.36), and male gender
      (OR=1.12). Those associated with a significant reduction in the odds of warfarin 
      use included alcohol/drug abuse (OR=0.62), perceived barriers to compliance
      (OR=0.87), contraindication(s) to warfarin (OR=0.81), dementia (OR=0.32), falls
      (OR=0.60), gastrointestinal hemorrhage (OR=0.47), intracranial hemorrhage
      (OR=0.39), hepatic (OR=0.59), and renal impairment (OR=0.69). While age per
      10-year increase (OR=0.78) and advancing age as a dichotomized variable (cut-off 
      varied by study) (OR=0.57) were associated with significant reductions in
      warfarin use; qualitative review of results of studies evaluating age as a
      categorical variable did not confirm this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin use
      has increased somewhat over time. The decision to prescribe warfarin for stroke
      prevention in atrial fibrillation is based upon multiple prescriber and patient
      characteristics. These findings can be used by family practice prescribers and
      other healthcare decision-makers to target interventions or methods to improve
      utilization of warfarin when it is indicated for stroke prevention.

TI  - The effects of a multilingual telephone quitline for Asian smokers: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 299-310
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djr530 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although telephone counseling services (quitlines) have become a
      popular behavioral intervention for smoking cessation in the United States, such 
      services are scarce for Asian immigrants with limited English proficiency. In
      this study, we tested the effects of telephone counseling for smoking cessation
      in Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese-speaking smokers. METHODS: A culturally
      tailored counseling protocol was developed in English and translated into
      Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese. We conducted a single randomized trial embedded 
      in the California quitline service. Smokers who called the quitline's Chinese,
      Korean, and Vietnamese telephone lines between August 2, 2004, and April 4, 2008,
      were recruited to the trial. Subjects (N = 2277) were stratified by language and 
      randomly assigned to telephone counseling (self-help materials and up to six
      counseling sessions; n = 1124 subjects) or self-help (self-help materials only; n
      = 1153 subjects) groups: 729 Chinese subjects (counseling = 359, self-help =
      370), 848 Korean subjects (counseling = 422, self-help = 426), and 700 Vietnamese
      subjects (counseling = 343, self-help = 357). The primary outcome was 6-month
      prolonged abstinence. Intention-to-treat analysis was used to estimate prolonged 
      abstinence rates for all subjects and for each language group. All statistical
      tests were two-sided. RESULTS: In the intention-to-treat analysis, counseling
      increased the 6-month prolonged abstinence rate among all smokers compared with
      self-help (counseling vs self-help, 16.4% vs 8.0%, difference = 8.4%, 95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 5.7% to 11.1%, P < .001). Counseling also increased
      the 6-month prolonged abstinence rate for each language group compared with
      self-help (counseling vs self-help, Chinese, 14.8% vs 6.0%, difference = 8.8%,
      95% CI = 4.4% to 13.2%, P < .001; Korean, 14.9% vs 5.2%, difference = 9.7%, 95%
      CI = 5.8% to 13.8%, P < .001; Vietnamese, 19.8% vs 13.5%, difference = 6.3%, 95% 
      CI = 0.9% to 11.9%, P = .023). CONCLUSIONS: Telephone counseling was effective
      for Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese-speaking smokers. This protocol should be
      incorporated into existing quitlines, with possible extension to other Asian
      languages.

TI  - Topiramate for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction: a multi-center
      placebo-controlled trial.
PG  - 1297-306
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2011.03771.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Topiramate has shown efficacy at facilitating abstinence from alcohol and
      cocaine abuse. This double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient trial tested
      topiramate for treating methamphetamine addiction. DESIGN: Participants (n = 140)
      were randomized to receive topiramate or placebo (13 weeks) in escalating doses
      from 25 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] to the target maintenance of 200 mg/day
      in weeks 6-12 (tapered in week 13). Medication was combined with weekly brief
      behavioral compliance enhancement treatment. SETTING: The trial was conducted at 
      eight medical centers in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and forty
      methamphetamine-dependent adults took part in the trial. MEASUREMENTS: The
      primary outcome was abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6-12. Secondary 
      outcomes included use reduction versus baseline, as well as psychosocial
      variables. FINDINGS: In the intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate did not increase
      abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6-12. For secondary outcomes,
      topiramate reduced weekly median urine methamphetamine levels and observer-rated 
      severity of dependence scores significantly. Subjects with negative urine before 
      randomization (n = 26) had significantly greater abstinence on topiramate versus 
      placebo during study weeks 6-12. Topiramate was safe and well tolerated.
      CONCLUSIONS: Topiramate does not appear to promote abstinence in methamphetamine 
      users but can reduce the amount taken and reduce relapse rates in those who are
      already abstinent.

TI  - Alcohol and marijuana use outcomes in the Healthy Choices motivational
      interviewing intervention for HIV-positive youth.
PG  - 95-100
LID - 10.1089/apc.2011.0157 [doi]
AB  - Healthy Choices is a motivational interviewing intervention targeting multiple
      risk behaviors among HIV-positive youth. This study investigated the effects of
      this intervention program specifically on alcohol and marijuana use. Youth living
      with HIV (n = 143, mean age = 20.7, 51.5% male) were recruited from four sites in
      the United States, and randomly assigned to intervention or control conditions.
      The four-session intervention focused on two of three possible problem behaviors 
      based on entry screening; this study focused on 143 HIV-positive youth who
      received the intervention for substance use. At 15-month follow-up past-week
      alcohol use was significantly lower for intervention youth than control youth
      (39.7% versus 53.6%, chi2 = 2.81, 0.05 < p < 0.01); developmental trajectory
      analysis demonstrated significant reductions in alcohol use, but more importantly
      the intervention was effective over time in significantly reducing the
      adolescent's probability of being classified into the high-risk trajectory group.
      The intervention was less effective in reducing marijuana use.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention for illicit drugs linked to
      the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) in clients
      recruited from primary health-care settings in four countries.
PG  - 957-66

AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a brief intervention (BI) for
      illicit drugs (cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-type stimulants and opioids) linked
      to the World Health Organization (WHO) Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement
      Screening Test (ASSIST). The ASSIST screens for problem or risky use of 10
      psychoactive substances, producing a score for each substance that falls into
      either a low-, moderate- or high-risk category. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized
      controlled trial in which participants were either assigned to a 3-month
      waiting-list control condition or received brief motivational counselling lasting
      an average of 13.8 minutes for the drug receiving the highest ASSIST score.
      SETTING: Primary health-care settings in four countries: Australia, Brazil, India
      and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 731 males and females scoring
      within the moderate-risk range of the ASSIST for cannabis, cocaine,
      amphetamine-type stimulants or opioids. MEASUREMENTS: ASSIST-specific substance
      involvement scores for cannabis, stimulants or opioids and ASSIST total illicit
      substance involvement score at baseline and 3 months post-randomization.
      FINDINGS: Omnibus analyses indicated that those receiving the BI had
      significantly reduced scores for all measures, compared with control
      participants. Country-specific analyses showed that, with the exception of the
      site in the United States, BI participants had significantly lower ASSIST total
      illicit substance involvement scores at follow-up compared with the control
      participants. The sites in India and Brazil demonstrated a very strong brief
      intervention effect for cannabis scores (P < 0.005 for both sites), as did the
      sites in Australia (P < 0.005) and Brazil (P < 0.01) for stimulant scores and the
      Indian site for opioid scores (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The Alcohol, Smoking and
      Substance Involvement Screening Test-linked brief intervention aimed at reducing 
      illicit substance use and related risks is effective, at least in the short term,
      and the effect generalizes across countries.

TI  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder prevalence estimates in correctional systems: a
      systematic literature review.
PG  - 336-40
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic search of the
      literature for studies that estimated the prevalence/incidence of Fetal Alcohol
      Spectrum Disorder (FASD) in correctional systems in different countries and,
      based on these data, to estimate a) the number of people with Fetal Alcohol
      Syndrome (FAS)/FASD within the criminal justice system population, and b) the
      relative risk of becoming imprisoned for individuals with FAS/FASD compared with 
      those without FAS/FASD. METHOD: A systematic world literature review of published
      and unpublished studies concerning the prevalence/incidence of FASD in
      correctional systems was conducted in multiple electronic bibliographic
      databases. SYNTHESIS: Very little empirical evidence is available on the
      prevalence of FASD in correctional systems. There were no studies estimating the 
      prevalence/incidence of FASD in correctional systems found for any country other 
      than Canada and the USA. The few studies that have identified incarcerated
      individuals with FASD estimate that the number of undiagnosed persons in
      correctional facilities is high. Based on available Canadian data, this study
      estimates that youths with FASD are 19 times more likely to be incarcerated than 
      youths without FASD in a given year. CONCLUSION: More studies investigating the
      prevalence/incidence of alcohol-affected people in the criminal justice system
      are required. There is an urgent need to raise awareness about the prevalence and
      disabilities of individuals with FASD in the criminal justice system and about
      appropriate responses. The criminal justice system is an ideal arena for
      intervention efforts aimed at the rehabilitation and prevention or reduction of
      recidivism in this unique population.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the relationship of diet to incident diabetes among non-Black
      and Black participants in the Adventist Health Study-2. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Participants were 15,200 men and 26,187 women (17.3% Blacks) across the U.S. and 
      Canada who were free of diabetes and who provided demographic, anthropometric,
      lifestyle and dietary data. Participants were grouped as vegan, lacto ovo
      vegetarian, pesco vegetarian, semi-vegetarian or non-vegetarian (reference
      group). A follow-up questionnaire after two years elicited information on the
      development of diabetes. Cases of diabetes developed in 0.54% of vegans, 1.08% of
      lacto ovo vegetarians, 1.29% of pesco vegetarians, 0.92% of semi-vegetarians and 
      2.12% of non-vegetarians. Blacks had an increased risk compared to non-Blacks
      (odds ratio [OR] 1.364; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.093-1.702). In multiple
      logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, education, income,
      television watching, physical activity, sleep, alcohol use, smoking and BMI,
      vegans (OR 0.381; 95% CI 0.236-0.617), lacto ovo vegetarians (OR 0.618; 95% CI
      0.503-0.760) and semi-vegetarians (OR 0.486, 95% CI 0.312-0.755) had a lower risk
      of diabetes than non-vegetarians. In non-Blacks vegan, lacto ovo and
      semi-vegetarian diets were protective against diabetes (OR 0.429, 95% CI
      0.249-0.740; OR 0.684, 95% CI 0.542-0.862; OR 0.501, 95% CI 0.303-0.827); among
      Blacks vegan and lacto ovo vegetarian diets were protective (OR 0.304, 95% CI
      0.110-0.842; OR 0.472, 95% CI 0.270-0.825). These associations were strengthened 
      when BMI was removed from the analyses. CONCLUSION: Vegetarian diets (vegan,
      lacto ovo, semi-) were associated with a substantial and independent reduction in
      diabetes incidence. In Blacks the dimension of the protection associated with
      vegetarian diets was as great as the excess risk associated with Black ethnicity.

TI  - Walking capacity of bariatric surgery candidates.
PG  - 48-59
LID - 10.1016/j.soard.2011.07.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study characterizes the walking limitations of bariatric surgery
      candidates by age and body mass index (BMI) and determines factors independently 
      associated with walking capacity. The setting was multi-institutional at research
      university hospitals in the United States. METHODS: Participants of the
      Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study (n=2458; age 18-78 yr, BMI
      33-94 kg/m(2)) attended a preoperative research visit. Their walking capacity was
      measured by self-report and the 400 m Long Distance Corridor Walk (LDCW).
      RESULTS: Almost two thirds (64%) of subjects reported limitations with walking
      several blocks, 48% had an objectively defined mobility deficit, and 16% reported
      at least some walking aid use. In multivariate analysis, BMI, older age, lower
      income, and greater bodily pain were independently associated (P < .05) with
      walking aid use, physical discomfort during the LDCW, an inability to complete
      the LDCW, and a slower time to complete the LDCW. Female gender, Hispanic
      ethnicity (but not race), greater heart rate at rest, a history of smoking,
      several co-morbidities (history of stroke, ischemic heart disease, diabetes,
      asthma, sleep apnea, venous edema with ulcerations), and depressive symptoms were
      also independently related (P < .05) to at least one measure of reduced walking
      capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Walking limitations are common in bariatric surgery
      candidates, even among the least severely obese and youngest patients. Physical
      activity counseling must be tailored to individuals' abilities. Although several 
      factors identified in the present study (eg, BMI, age, pain, co-morbidities)
      should be considered, directly assessing the patient's walking capacity will
      facilitate appropriate goal setting.

AB  - AIMS: Evidence indicates that Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) participation reduces
      relapse risk but less is known about the mechanisms through which AA confers this
      benefit. Initial studies indicate self-efficacy, negative affect, adaptive social
      networks and spiritual practices are mediators of this effect, but because these 
      have been tested in isolation, their relative importance remains elusive. This
      study tested multiple mediators simultaneously to help determine the most
      influential pathways. DESIGN: Prospective, statistically controlled, naturalistic
      investigation examined the extent to which these previously identified mechanisms
      mediated AA attendance effects on alcohol outcomes controlling for baseline
      outcome values, mediators, treatment, and other confounders. SETTING: Nine
      clinical sites within the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 1726)
      suffering from alcohol use disorder (AUD) initially enrolled in a randomized
      study with two arms: aftercare (n = 774); and out-patient (n = 952) comparing
      three out-patient treatments (Project MATCH). MEASUREMENTS: AA attendance during 
      treatment; mediators at 9 months; and outcomes [percentage of days abstinent
      (PDA) and drinks per drinking day (DDD)] at 15 months. FINDINGS: Among
      out-patients the effect of AA attendance on alcohol outcomes was explained
      primarily by adaptive social network changes and increases in social abstinence
      self-efficacy. Among more impaired aftercare patients, in addition to mediation
      through adaptive network changes and increases in social self-efficacy, AA lead
      to better outcomes through increasing spirituality/religiosity and by reducing
      negative affect. The degree to which mediators explained the relationship between
      AA and outcomes ranged from 43% to 67%. CONCLUSION: While Alcoholics Anonymous
      facilitates recovery by mobilizing several processes simultaneously, it is
      changes in social factors which appear to be of primary importance.

AB  - Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for Canadians.
      Immigrants underutilize screening and may be at greater risk of late stage
      diagnosis and death from the disease. This mixed-methods study investigated the
      self-reported causes of colon cancer by 66 English-as-a-Second-Language Chinese
      immigrant women to Canada after reading a fact sheet which listed two causes of
      colon cancer (polyps and cause unknown) and six ways to help prevent colon cancer
      (lifestyle, diet, weight, smoking, alcohol, and screening). Women correctly named
      or described both causes (6.1%) or one cause (22.7%), could not name or describe 
      either cause (19.7%), or named or described causes not included on the fact sheet
      (54.5%). The most common causes reported by participants were "risk factors":
      diet (53.0%), family history (28.8%), and lifestyle (22.7%). Women confused cause
      with risk factor and infrequently mentioned screening. Possible reasons for their
      reported beliefs are discussed.

TI  - Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and antiemetic prophylaxis with
      palonosetron versus other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists in patients with cancer
      treated with low emetogenic chemotherapy in a hospital outpatient setting in the 
      United States.
PG  - 1613-22
LID - 10.1185/03007995.2011.596201 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of overall (acute and delayed) chemotherapy-induced
      nausea and vomiting (CINV) events among patients treated with single- and
      multi-day low emetogenic chemotherapy (LEC) is not well established. We studied a
      cohort of patients receiving LEC and antiemetic prophylaxis with palonosetron
      (Group 1) versus other 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists (5-HT(3)-RAs) (Group 2), to
      determine the overall rate of CINV and the proportion of patients experiencing
      delayed CINV (days 2-7 of a CT cycle) in a hospital outpatient setting. METHODS: 
      Patients aged >/=18 years with cancer diagnosis initiating single-day and
      multi-day LEC for the first time between 4/1/2007 and 3/31/2009 were identified
      from the Premier Perspective database. CINV events (ICD-9-CM codes for nausea,
      vomiting, or volume depletion or CINV-related rescue medications) were assessed
      descriptively. A generalized linear multivariate regression model was developed, 
      estimating the overall CINV event rate among Group 1 and 2 patients in the
      follow-up period (first of eight chemotherapy [CT] cycles or 6 months). RESULTS: 
      In the follow-up period, out of a total of 10,137 overall CINV events (single-day
      and multi-day LEC), 8783 events (86.6%) were identified in single-day LEC treated
      patients. Within single-day LEC treated events, in the first cycle, of 3184
      events, 2996 (94.1%) events were delayed. Average number of delayed events per
      patient remained consistent throughout the eight cycles (3.1 [1st cycle] vs. 2.9 
      [8th cycle]; P = 0.842]). Among 2439 patients on antiemetic prophylaxis with a
      5-HT(3)-RA, 10.1% (n = 247) initiated palonosetron. Regression analysis indicated
      that Group 1 patients (versus Group 2) had a 15.2% reduction in CINV event rate
      per CT cycle; P = 0.0403. Study limitations include potential lack of
      generalizability, absence of data on certain confounders including alcohol
      consumption and prior history of motion sickness, potential underestimation of
      incidence of uncontrolled CINV, and inability to draw conclusions pertaining to
      cause and effect relationship. CONCLUSION: In this retrospective analysis,
      delayed CINV comprised a major proportion of overall CINV among cancer diagnosed 
      patients on single-day LEC. Additionally, palonosetron prophylaxis was associated
      with a significantly lower overall CINV event rate versus other 5-HT(3)-RA
      prophylaxis in single- and multi-day LEC treatment.

TI  - Gender, race, and group behavior in group drug treatment.
PG  - e39-45
LID - 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2011.05.023 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Group drug counseling is the primary treatment modality used to treat
      drug dependence in community settings in the United States. Findings from the
      social psychology literature suggest that gender may influence how individuals
      participate in groups, and that race may moderate the effects of gender on group 
      behavior. This study examined gender, race, and their interaction as predictors
      of alliance, participation, self-disclosure, and receipt of advice and feedback
      in drug counseling groups, and explored how gender and racial differences in drug
      counseling group behavior related to outcome of cocaine dependence treatment.
      METHOD: Ratings of group behavior were made from videotaped sessions of group
      drug counseling drawn from a randomized trial of treatment for cocaine-dependent 
      individuals (n=438). Analyses examined the effects of race (African American or
      non-Hispanic White), gender, and the race by gender interaction on group
      behavior. Additional analyses examined race, gender, and group behavior, and
      interactions among these variables in predicting monthly cocaine use. RESULTS:
      Race and the race by gender interaction, but not gender alone, predicted many
      group behaviors. Non-Hispanic White women had the highest rates of
      self-disclosure and receipt of advice and non-positive feedback, followed by men 
      of both races, with African American women having the lowest levels. These
      differences were unrelated to cross-sectional cocaine outcome. CONCLUSIONS:
      Women, but not men, of different races acted differently in mixed-race,
      mixed-gender cocaine treatment groups, with African American women exhibiting
      less of several behaviors. Additional research on causes and consequences of
      these differences could inform interventions for drug-dependent women.

TI  - Effects of varenicline in adult smokers: a multinational, 24-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
PG  - 465-77
LID - 10.1016/j.clinthera.2011.04.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence rates of smoking are rising in developing countries.
      Previous trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of the smoking-cessation
      medication varenicline have used largely participants of Caucasian origin.
      OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 
      varenicline in populations of participants from Latin America, Africa, and the
      Middle East to investigate potential differences in the therapeutic response to
      varenicline. METHODS: This multinational, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial was conducted at 42 centers in 11 countries (Latin
      America: Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Venezuela; Africa: Egypt and
      South Africa; Middle East: Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
      Emirates). Participants were male and female smokers aged 18 to 75 years who were
      motivated to stop smoking; smoked >/=10 cigarettes/d, with no cumulative period
      of abstinence >3 months in the previous year; and who had no serious or unstable 
      disease within the previous 6 months. Subjects were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 
      receive varenicline 1 mg or placebo, BID for 12 weeks, with a 12-week
      nontreatment follow-up. Brief smoking-cessation counseling was provided. The main
      outcome measures were carbon monoxide-confirmed continuous abstinence rate (CAR) 
      at weeks 9 to 12 and weeks 9 to 24. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded for
      tolerability assessment. RESULTS: Overall, 588 subjects (varenicline, 390;
      placebo, 198) were randomized and treated. The mean (SD) ages of subjects in the 
      varenicline and placebo groups were 43.1 (10.8) and 43.9 (10.8) years,
      respectively; 57.7% and 65.7% were male; and the mean (SD) weights were 75.0
      (16.0) and 76.7 (16.3) kg (range, 40.0-130.0 and 45.6-126.0 kg). CAR at weeks 9
      to 12 was significantly higher with varenicline than with placebo (53.59% vs
      18.69%; odds ratio [OR] = 5.76; 95% CI, 3.74-8.88; P < 0.0001), and this rate was
      maintained during weeks 9 to 24 (39.74% vs 13.13%; OR = 4.78; 95% CI, 2.97-7.68; 
      P < 0.0001). Nausea, headache, and insomnia were the most commonly reported AEs
      with varenicline and were reported numerically more frequently in the varenicline
      group compared with the placebo group. Serious AEs (SAEs) were reported in 2.8%
      of varenicline recipients compared with 1.0% in the placebo group, with 6
      subjects reporting psychiatric SAEs compared with none in the placebo group.
      CONCLUSION: Based on these data, varenicline was apparently efficacious and
      generally well tolerated as a smoking-cessation aid in smokers from selected
      sites in Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East. ClinicalTrials.gov

AB  - The greatest prevalence of tobacco use in the United States occurs with the
      American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN). A critical need exists for a
      culturally specific tobacco cessation option for AI/AN youth. The nurse
      practitioner is positioned to provide a culturally specific commercial tobacco
      cessation option by incorporating the transcultural nursing theory into the
      development of a decision tree to expand understanding of culturally appropriate 
      best practices regarding screening and management of tobacco smoking cessation in
      AI/AN youth. Presented is the Nurse Practitioner Culturally Specific American
      Indian and Alaskan Native Youth Decision Tree for Smoking Cessation with
      supporting evidence-based best practices.

TI  - Treatment outcomes of a stage 1 cognitive-behavioral trial to reduce alcohol use 
      among human immunodeficiency virus-infected out-patients in western Kenya.

AB  - AIMS: Dual epidemics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and alcohol use
      disorders, and a dearth of professional resources for behavioral treatment in
      sub-Saharan Africa, suggest the need for development of culturally relevant and
      feasible interventions. The purpose of this study was to test the preliminary
      efficacy of a culturally adapted six-session gender-stratified group
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to
      reduce alcohol use among HIV-infected out-patients in Eldoret, Kenya. DESIGN:
      Randomized clinical trial comparing CBT against a usual care assessment-only
      control. SETTING: A large HIV out-patient clinic in Eldoret, Kenya, part of the
      Academic Model for Providing Access to Healthcare collaboration. PARTICIPANTS:
      Seventy-five HIV-infected out-patients who were antiretroviral (ARV)-initiated or
      ARV-eligible and who reported hazardous or binge drinking. MEASUREMENTS:
      Percentage of drinking days (PDD) and mean drinks per drinking days (DDD)
      measured continuously using the Time line Follow back method. FINDINGS: There
      were 299 ineligible and 102 eligible out-patients with 12 refusals. Effect sizes 
      of the change in alcohol use since baseline between the two conditions at the
      30-day follow-up were large [d=0.95, P=0.0002, mean difference=24.93, 95%
      confidence interval (CI): 12.43, 37.43 PDD; d=0.76, P=0.002, mean
      difference=2.88, 95% CI: 1.05, 4.70 DDD]. Randomized participants attended 93% of
      the six CBT sessions offered. Reported alcohol abstinence at the 90-day follow-up
      was 69% (CBT) and 38% (usual care). Paraprofessional counselors achieved
      independent ratings of adherence and competence equivalent to college-educated
      therapists in the United States. Treatment effect sizes were comparable to
      alcohol intervention studies conducted in the United States. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cognitive-behavioral therapy can be adapted successfully to group
      paraprofessional delivery in Kenya and may be effective in reducing alcohol use
      among HIV-infected Kenyan out-patients.

TI  - A review of tobacco use treatments in U.S. ethnic minority populations.
PG  - S11-30
LID - 10.4278/ajhp.100610-LIT-177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in 
      the United States. Among racial and ethnic minorities, disparities in tobacco
      use, knowledge of health risks and treatment resources, and access to and
      utilization of treatment contribute to a disproportionate disease burden from
      tobacco use. Furthermore, racial and ethnic minorities have been underrepresented
      within tobacco treatment studies. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: This paper provides a review
      of published studies examining tobacco treatment interventions among ethnic and
      minority populations in the United States. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Literature
      searches were used to identify smoking cessation interventions involving
      racial/ethnic minority populations. Identified studies were published between
      1985 and 2009 involving African-American, Latino, Native American, and Asian or
      Pacific Islander smokers. Studies included in the review (1) targeted one or more
      ethnic minority group or had at least 10% of study participants from ethnic
      minority groups and (2) reported abstinence outcomes. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies
      were included in this review. Of studies meeting inclusion criteria, 28 included 
      a primary focus on African-Americans, 10 focused on Latinos, 4 focused on Native 
      Americans, and 3 focused on Asian-American smokers. An additional 19 studies
      reported samples including participants from more than one minority group. Sample
      inclusion criteria, intervention content and duration, follow-up, abstinence
      assessment, and limitations of these studies were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS:
      Individuals from racial and ethnic minority populations are interested in
      stopping smoking and willing to participate in treatment research. Variations in 
      the content of treatment intervention and study design produced a range of
      abstinence outcomes across studies. Additional research is needed for all groups,
      including African-American smokers, and special attention is warranted for
      Latino, Native American, and Asian groups given the paucity of published studies.
      Although there were limited evaluations of pharmacotherapy, the existing data
      support use of pharmacotherapy in addition to counseling for enhancing abstinence
      outcomes. Further attention to level of individual smoking, variability in
      smoking patterns, and use of other tobacco products is needed, given known
      variation within and between racial and ethnic groups. Overall, findings are
      consistent with recommendations from the 2008 Clinical Practice Guidelines
      calling for increased research devoted to evaluating and enhancing tobacco use
      treatment interventions among racial and ethnic minority populations.

      research.
PG  - 603-16
LID - 10.1177/1090198110389709 [doi]
AB  - This systematic review critically synthesizes the literature focusing on factors 
      related to preconception health behaviors (PCHBs) among childbearing age women in
      the United States, developed countries, and developing countries. Ovid Medline
      and CINAHL databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between
      1998 and 2008 relating to PCHB. Six major categories of factors were identified: 
      frequency of alcohol intake prior and during pregnancy, glycemic control/diabetes
      management, physical activity before and during pregnancy, pregnancy planning
      behavior, cystic fibrosis carrier screening, and other risk factors. A critical
      finding of this review is that knowledge, awareness, and beliefs of preconception
      care do not lead to preconception health practice. Younger preconceptional women 
      and women with children were less likely to engage in PCHB. However, women with
      advanced postgraduate education were more likely to practice preconception care. 
      There is an urgent need to educate young preconceptional women regarding the
      importance and benefits of practicing preconception care.

TI  - A randomized, controlled study of treatment for alcohol dependence in patients
      awaiting liver transplantation.
PG  - 539-47
LID - 10.1002/lt.22259 [doi]
AB  - Alcohol is the second most common cause of cirrhosis necessitating liver
      transplantation in the United States, yet rates of posttransplant drinking
      approach 50% and no controlled clinical trials of alcoholism treatment exist in
      this population. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive Motivational
      Enhancement Therapy (MET), or referral to local treatment sources ("treatment as 
      usual" [TAU]). Addictive behavior, mood states, and general health were compared.
      Candor concerning alcohol use was encouraged by keeping drinking questionnaires
      in confidence, except in medical emergencies. Ninety-one subjects were studied;
      46 received MET, 45 received TAU, 29 proceeded to transplantation (MET, n = 13;
      TAU, n = 16). A total of 69 subjects completed 24 weeks of observation, and 25
      subjects were assessed at 96 weeks. No difference in study attendance was
      observed, but significantly more MET subjects attended 1 or more treatment
      sessions. Twenty-three subjects (25% of sample) drank after randomization but
      before transplant. Excluding an extreme outlier, MET drinkers had significantly
      fewer drinks per drinking days than TAU drinkers. Neither treatment plan resulted
      in significant variances in measures of psychosocial health. In conclusion,
      although MET afforded no significant benefit over TAU for mood or general health 
      outcomes, this study provides some degree of support for MET to limit the
      quantity and frequency of pretransplant alcohol consumption among liver
      transplant candidates with alcohol dependence. However, because of the limited
      number of study subjects, these data must be interpreted cautiously. Further
      research to validate our findings or to identify better methods to identify and
      intervene with patients at risk of pretransplant and posttransplant drinking
      should continue.

      populations: a systematic review.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-244 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to systematically review the medical 
      literature for the prevalence of waterpipe tobacco use among the general and
      specific populations. METHODS: We electronically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
      the ISI the Web of Science. We selected studies using a two-stage duplicate and
      independent screening process. We included cohort studies and cross sectional
      studies assessing the prevalence of use of waterpipe in either the general
      population or a specific population of interest. Two reviewers used a
      standardized and pilot tested form to collect data from each eligible study using
      a duplicate and independent screening process. We stratified the data analysis by
      country and by age group. The study was not restricted to a specific context.
      RESULTS: Of a total of 38 studies, only 4 were national surveys; the rest
      assessed specific populations. The highest prevalence of current waterpipe
      smoking was among school students across countries: the United States, especially
      among Arab Americans (12%-15%) the Arabic Gulf region (9%-16%), Estonia (21%),
      and Lebanon (25%). Similarly, the prevalence of current waterpipe smoking among
      university students was high in the Arabic Gulf region (6%), the United Kingdom
      (8%), the United States (10%), Syria (15%), Lebanon (28%), and Pakistan (33%).
      The prevalence of current waterpipe smoking among adults was the following:
      Pakistan (6%), Arabic Gulf region (4%-12%), Australia (11% in Arab speaking
      adults), Syria (9%-12%), and Lebanon (15%). Group waterpipe smoking was high in
      Lebanon (5%), and Egypt (11%-15%). In Lebanon, 5%-6% pregnant women reported
      smoking waterpipe during pregnancy. The studies were all cross-sectional and
      varied by how they reported waterpipe smoking. CONCLUSION: While very few
      national surveys have been conducted, the prevalence of waterpipe smoking appears
      to be alarmingly high among school students and university students in Middle
      Eastern countries and among groups of Middle Eastern descent in Western
      countries.

      binge drinking.
PG  - 389-99

AB  - CONTEXT: Excessive consumption of alcohol is a major problem in the United States
      and abroad. Despite many years of study, it is unclear why some individuals drink
      alcohol excessively while others do not. It has been postulated that either lower
      or greater acute responses to alcohol, or both, depending on the limb of the
      breath alcohol concentration curve, contribute to propensity for alcohol misuse. 
      OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess the relationship of acute alcohol responses to
      future binge drinking. DESIGN: Within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      multidose laboratory alcohol challenge study with intensive follow-up. Each
      participant completed 3 randomized sessions examining responses to a high (0.8
      g/kg) and low (0.4 g/kg) alcohol dose and placebo, followed by quarterly
      assessments for 2 years examining drinking behaviors and alcohol diagnoses.
      SETTING: Participants recruited from the community. PARTICIPANTS: High-risk heavy
      social drinkers aged 21 to 35 years who habitually engage in weekly binge
      drinking (n = 104) and light drinker controls (n = 86). INTERVENTION: We
      conducted 570 laboratory sessions with a subsequent 99.1% follow-up (1506 of
      1520). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale, Drug Effects
      Questionnaire, cortisol response, Timeline Follow-Back, Drinker Inventory of
      Consequences-Recent, and DSM-IV alcohol abuse and dependence. RESULTS: Alcohol
      produced greater stimulant and rewarding (liking and wanting) responses and lower
      sedative and cortisol responses in heavy vs light drinkers. Among the heavy
      drinkers, greater positive effects and lower sedative effects after alcohol
      consumption predicted increased binge drinking frequency during follow-up. In
      turn, greater frequency of binge drinking during follow-up was associated with
      greater likelihood of meeting diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuse and
      dependence. CONCLUSIONS: The widely held low level response theory and
      differentiator model should be revised: in high-risk drinkers, stimulant and
      rewarding alcohol responses even at peak breath alcohol concentrations are
      important predictors of future alcohol problems. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Intervention induced changes on parenting practices, youth self-pride and sexual 
      norms to reduce HIV-related behaviors among rural African American youths.
PG  - 1147-63
LID - 10.1007/s10964-011-9642-x [doi]
AB  - AIDS is the leading killer of African Americans between the ages of 25 and 44,
      many of whom became infected when they were teenagers or young adults. The
      disparity in HIV infection rate among African Americans youth residing in rural
      Southern regions of the United States suggests that there is an urgent need to
      identify ways to promote early preventive intervention to reduce HIV-related risk
      behavior. The Strong African American Families (SAAF) program, a preventive
      intervention for rural African American parents and their 11-year-olds, was
      specially designed to deter early sexual onset and the initiation and escalation 
      of alcohol and drug use among rural African American preadolescents. A
      clustered-randomized prevention trial was conducted, contrasting families who
      took part in SAAF with control families. The trial, which included 332 families, 
      indicated that intervention-induced changes occurred in intervention-targeted
      parenting, which in turn facilitated changes in youths' internal protective
      processes and positive sexual norms. Long-term follow up assessments when youth
      were 17 years old revealed that intervention-induced changes in parenting
      practices mediated the effect of intervention-group influences on changes in the 
      onset and escalation of risky sexual behaviors over 65 months through its
      positive influence on adolescents' self-pride and their sexual norms. The
      findings underscore the powerful effects of parenting practices among rural
      African American families that over time serve a protective role in reducing
      youth's risk behavior, including HIV vulnerable behaviors.

PG  - 1268-74
LID - 10.1016/j.rmed.2011.02.005 [doi]
AB  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affects more than 24 million
      individuals in the United States, although at least half of the cases are not
      diagnosed. Proactive diagnosis and limitation of risk exposure from smoking or
      pollutants are important to improve prognosis. Pharmacologic treatments are
      prescribed according to COPD stage and symptoms. Mild COPD is symptomatically
      treated 'as needed' with short-acting bronchodilators; major guidelines recommend
      starting maintenance treatment at the moderate COPD stage with long-acting
      bronchodilators; inhaled corticosteroids may be added for patients with more
      severe disease and frequent exacerbations. Maintenance therapy preserves 24-h
      airway patency, reduces exacerbations, and improves activity tolerance and
      health-related quality of life. Recent post-hoc analyses of large clinical trials
      that contain subgroups of patients with less severe COPD suggest that, similar to
      those with advanced disease, patients with moderate disease benefit from
      long-term maintenance therapies. Studies suggest symptomatic mild patients may
      also benefit. This concept needs to be prospectively tested in studies specific
      to these COPD disease stages. Proactive identification and pharmacologic
      intervention in early COPD has the potential to alter clinical outcomes
      throughout the disease course.

PG  - 751-5
LID - 10.1097/AOG.0b013e318214784e [doi]
AB  - Methamphetamine abuse has continued to increase in the United States since the
      late 1980s with its use spreading from the West Coast to areas across the
      country. Methamphetamine use in pregnancy endangers the health of the woman and
      increases the risk of low birth weight and small for gestational age babies and
      such use may increase the risk of neurodevelopmental problems in children. All
      pregnant women should be asked about their drug and alcohol use. Urine toxicology
      screening may be useful in detecting methamphetamine and other substance abuse
      during pregnancy, but this screening should only be done with maternal consent
      after counseling regarding the potential ramifications of a positive test result.
      Women reporting continuing use of methamphetamine in pregnancy should be referred
      for treatment and followed up with serial ultrasound examinations to assess fetal
      growth.

TI  - Evaluating a selective prevention programme for binge drinking among young
      adolescents: study protocol of a randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 126
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-11-126 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In comparison to other Europe countries, Dutch adolescents are at the
      top in drinking frequency and binge drinking. A total of 75% of the Dutch 12 to
      16 year olds who drink alcohol also engage in binge drinking. A prevention
      programme called Preventure was developed in Canada to prevent adolescents from
      binge drinking. This article describes a study that aims to assess the effects of
      this selective school-based prevention programme in The Netherlands. METHODS: A
      randomized controlled trial is being conducted among 13 to 15-year-old
      adolescents in secondary schools. Schools were randomly assigned to the
      intervention and control conditions. The intervention condition consisted of two 
      90 minute group sessions, carried out at the participants' schools and provided
      by a qualified counsellor and a co-facilitator. The intervention targeted young
      adolescents who demonstrated personality risk for alcohol abuse. The group
      sessions were adapted to four personality profiles. The control condition
      received no further intervention above the standard substance use education
      sessions provided in the Dutch national curriculum. The primary outcomes will be 
      the percentage reduction in binge drinking, weekly drinking and drinking-related 
      problems after three specified time periods. A screening survey collected data by
      means of an Internet questionnaire. Students have completed, or will complete, a 
      post-treatment survey after 2, 6, and 12 months, also by means of an online
      questionnaire. DISCUSSION: This study protocol presents the design and current
      implementation of a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      a selective alcohol prevention programme. We expect that a significantly lower
      number of adolescents will binge drink, drink weekly, and have drinking-related
      problems in the intervention condition compared to the control condition, as a
      result of this intervention. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered in the 
      Dutch Trial Register (Cochrane Collaboration) as NTR1920.

TI  - Healthy lifestyle on the risk of breast cancer.
PG  - 912-22
LID - 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-10-1036 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many studies have analyzed the effect of behavioral risk factors such
      as common lifestyle patterns on the risk of disease. The aim of this study was to
      assess the effect of a healthy lifestyle index on the risk of breast cancer.
      METHODS: A population-based case-control study was conducted in Mexico from 2004 
      to 2007. One thousand incident cases and 1,074 controls, matched to cases by
      5-year age category, region, and health institution, participated in the study. A
      healthy lifestyle index was developed by means of principal components by using
      dietary pattern, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and tobacco smoking. A
      conditional logistic regression model was used to assess this association.
      RESULTS: The healthy lifestyle index was defined as the combined effect of
      moderate and/or vigorous-intensity physical activity, low consumption of fat,
      processed foods, refined cereals, complex sugars, and the avoidance of tobacco
      smoking and alcohol consumption. Results showed a protective effect on both pre- 
      (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84) and postmenopausal women (OR = O.20, 95% CI:
      0.11-0.37) when highest versus lowest index quintiles were compared. CONCLUSIONS:
      Healthy lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the odds of having breast
      cancer. Primary prevention of this disease should be promoted in an integrated
      manner. Effective strategies need to be identified to engage women in healthy
      lifestyles. IMPACT: This study is the first to assess a healthy lifestyle index
      in relation to the risk of breast cancer.

TI  - A randomized trial of Internet and telephone treatment for smoking cessation.
PG  - 46-53
LID - 10.1001/archinternmed.2010.451 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the relative effect of Internet and
      Internet plus telephone treatment for smoking cessation on smoking abstinence
      among US adults. A priori hypotheses were that Internet enhanced with tailored
      content and social support would outperform basic Internet (BI) and that enhanced
      Internet (EI) plus proactive telephone counseling would outperform the other
      conditions. METHODS: The Quit Using Internet and Telephone Treatment (iQUITT)
      study used a 3-group randomized controlled design comparing BI, EI, and EI and
      telephone combined (EI+P). The trial was conducted from March 8, 2005, through
      November 30, 2008. Current adult smokers in the United States who smoked 5 or
      more cigarettes per day were recruited via search engines. Characteristics of the
      2005 participants include mean (SD) age of 35.9 (10.8) years, 51.1% women, and
      86.5% white. The follow-up assessment rate at 18 months was 68.2%. The main
      outcome measure was 30-day point prevalence abstinence measured at 3, 6, 12, and 
      18 months after randomization using intent-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: At 18
      months, the 30-day multiple point prevalence abstinence rate across all follow-up
      intervals was 3.5% (BI), 4.5% (EI), and 7.7% (EI+P), with EI+P significantly
      outperforming BI and EI. At 18 months, 30-day single point prevalence abstinence 
      rates were 19.0% (BI), 17.4% (EI), and 19.6% (EI+P) and did not differ among the 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: Combined Internet and telephone treatment outperforms static
      and dynamic Internet interventions. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - Depression and suicide are of increasing concern on college campuses. This
      article presents data from the College Health Intervention Projects on the
      frequency of depression and suicide ideation among 1,622 college students who
      accessed primary care services in 4 university clinics in the Midwest, Northwest,
      and Canada. Students completed the Beck Depression Inventory and other measures
      related to exercise patterns, alcohol use, sensation seeking, and violence. The
      frequency of depression was similar for men (25%) and women (26%). Thought of
      suicide was higher for men (13%) than women (10%). Tobacco use, emotional abuse, 
      and unwanted sexual encounters were all associated with screening positive for
      depression. "Days of exercise per week" was inversely associated with screening
      positive for depression. Because the majority of students access campus-based
      student health centers, medical providers can serve a key role in early
      identification and intervention. With every 4th student reporting symptoms of
      depression and every 10th student having suicidal thoughts, such interventions
      are needed.

TI  - Alcohol use and pregnancy consensus clinical guidelines.
PG  - S1-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to establish national standards of care for the screening and
      recording of alcohol use and counselling on alcohol use of women of child-bearing
      age and pregnant women based on the most up-to-date evidence. EVIDENCE: published
      literature was retrieved through searches of PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane
      Library in May 2009 using appropriate controlled vocabulary (e.g., pregnancy
      complications, alcohol drinking, prenatal care) and key words (e.g., pregnancy,
      alcohol consumption, risk reduction). Results were restricted to literature
      published in the last five years with the following research designs: systematic 
      reviews, randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational 
      studies. There were no language restrictions. Searches were updated on a regular 
      basis and incorporated in the guideline to May 2010. Grey (unpublished)
      literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology
      assessment (HTA) and HTA-related agencies, national and international medical
      specialty societies, clinical practice guideline collections, and clinical trial 
      registries. Each article was screened for relevance and the full text acquired if
      determined to be relevant. The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by
      the members of the Expert Workgroup established by the Society of Obstetricians
      and Gynaecologists of Canada. The quality of evidence was evaluated and
      recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task 
      Force on Preventive Health Care. VALUES: the quality of evidence was rated using 
      the criteria described by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care
      (Table 1). SPONSOR: the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Society of
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. ENDORSEMENT: these consensus
      guidelines have been endorsed by the Association of Obstetricians and
      Gynecologists of Quebec; the Canadian Association of Midwives; the Canadian
      Association of Perinatal, Women's Health and Neonatal Nurses (CAPWHN); the
      College of Family Physicians of Canada; the Federation of Medical Women of
      Canada; the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada; and Motherisk. SUMMARY
      STATEMENTS: 1. There is evidence that alcohol consumption in pregnancy can cause 
      fetal harm. (II-2) There is insufficient evidence regarding fetal safety or harm 
      at low levels of alcohol consumption in pregnancy. (III) 2. There is insufficient
      evidence to define any threshold for low-level drinking in pregnancy. (III) 3.
      Abstinence is the prudent choice for a woman who is or might become pregnant.
      (III) 4. Intensive culture-, gender-, and family-appropriate interventions need
      to be available and accessible for women with problematic drinking and/or alcohol
      dependence. (II-2). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. Universal screening for alcohol
      consumption should be done periodically for all pregnant women and women of
      child-bearing age. Ideally, at-risk drinking could be identified before
      pregnancy, allowing for change. (II-2B) 2. Health care providers should create a 
      safe environment for women to report alcohol consumption. (III-A) 3. The public
      should be informed that alcohol screening and support for women at risk is part
      of routine women's health care. (III-A) 4. Health care providers should be aware 
      of the risk factors associated with alcohol use in women of reproductive age.
      (III-B) 5. Brief interventions are effective and should be provided by health
      care providers for women with at-risk drinking. (II-2B) 6. If a woman continues
      to use alcohol during pregnancy, harm reduction/treatment strategies should be
      encouraged. (II-2B) 7. Pregnant women should be given priority access to
      withdrawal management and treatment. (III-A) 8. Health care providers should
      advise women that low-level consumption of alcohol in early pregnancy is not an
      indication for termination of pregnancy. (II-2A).

TI  - Clinical recommendations for oral cancer screening.
PG  - 101-2
LID - 10.1038/sj.ebd.6400750 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE AND PURPOSE: To address the benefits and limitations of oral cancer
      screening and the use of adjunctive screening aids to visualise and detect
      potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions. Squamous cell carcinomas of the
      lips and cancers of the oropharynx (including the posterior one-third of the base
      of the tongue and the tonsils were excluded. METHODOLOGY: A specially convened
      expert panel evaluated the available evidence which was derived from a systematic
      search of Medline and the Cochrane Library. Further details about the search are 
      available in a supplement to the published article available on the Journal of
      the America Dental Association's website
      (http://jada.ada.org/cgi/content/full/141/5/509). Qualitative synthesis of the
      data was performed by the panel. Where consensus could not be reached majority
      voting was employed. Recommendations were reviewed by internal and external
      scientific experts and organisations. After review recommendations were revised
      where appropriate and the ADA Council on Scientific Affairs approved the final
      clinical recommendations. REVIEW AND UPDATING: No information provided in
      article. RECOMMENDATIONS: The key recommendations were all classified as level D 
      being based on grade IV evidence or extrapolated from grade I, II or III evidence
      using a system based on Shekelle et al.(1) The main recommendations can be
      summarised as:1) Clinicians should remain alert for signs of potentially
      malignant lesions or early-stage cancers in all patients while performing routine
      visual and tactile examinations, particularly for patients who use tobacco or who
      are heavy consumers of alcohol. 2) For seemingly innocuous lesions, clinicians
      should follow up in seven to 14 days to confirm persistence after removing any
      possible cause to reduce the potential for false-positive screening results. 3)
      For lesions that raise suspicion of cancer or for lesions that persist after
      removal of a possible cause, clinicians should communicate the potential benefits
      and risks of early diagnosis. Considerations include the following: a) that even 
      suspicious lesions identified during the course of a routine visual and tactile
      examination may represent false positives; b) that clinical confirmation (a
      second opinion) can be sought from a dental or medical care provider with
      advanced training and experience in diagnosis of oral mucosal disease so as to
      reduce the potential for a false positive or false negative oral cancer screening
      result; c) that a malignancy or non-malignancy can be confirmed only via
      microscopic examination that requires a surgical biopsy; d) that a decision to
      pursue a biopsy to confirm the presence or absence of malignancy should be made
      in the context of informed consent. 4) Although transepithelial cytology has
      validity in identifying disaggregated dysplastic cells, the panel suggests
      surgical biopsy for definitive diagnosis. RESEARCH RECOMMENDATIONS: In all, 15
      separate research recommendations were made ranging from determining the
      prevalence of potentially malignant oral mucosal lesions in the United States to 
      whether the use of adjunctive devices improves patient education and adherence to
      follow-up care.

TI  - Effectiveness of pharmacist counseling combined with nicotine replacement
      therapy: a pragmatic randomized trial with 6,987 smokers.
PG  - 167-80
LID - 10.1007/s10552-010-9672-9 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacists may be effective health care practitioners to deliver smoking
      cessation interventions. This paper examines the short-term outcomes of smokers
      randomized to one of two models of a pharmacist-led smoking cessation
      intervention. METHODS: An open-label pragmatic randomized trial compared two
      models of a pharmacist-led behavioral intervention [Group A (3-sessions) vs.
      Group B (1-session)] in conjunction with 5 weeks of nicotine replacement therapy 
      (NRT). Ninety-eight pharmacies in Ontario, Canada delivered the intervention.
      Baseline demographic and smoking behavior data were recorded, as were
      intervention characteristics. Self-reported, 7-day point prevalence quit rates
      were obtained 5-week postintervention start date. RESULTS: 6,987 individuals
      participated; 51.4% (n = 3588) randomized to Group A; 48.6% (n = 3399) to Group
      B. Approximately, 50% of Group A participants completed all three sessions. Quit 
      rates were significantly higher among Group A, 3-session completers (27.7%; n =
      478) compared to Group B participants (18.0%; n = 604). Multivariable results
      suggest that even when controlling for possible confounders and clustering across
      pharmacies, Group A participants who completed all three sessions were more
      likely to quit compared to Group B [OR = 1.72 (95% CI: 1.53, 1.94)]. CONCLUSIONS:
      Cessation outcomes are higher among participants completing three intervention
      sessions compared to one session; however, many do not return for follow-up
      sessions.

TI  - Impact of providing drinkers with "know your limit" information on drinking and
      driving: a field experiment.
PG  - 79-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Given that most effective alcohol harm-reduction laws specify the
      blood alcohol concentration (BAC) that constitutes illegal behavior (e.g., the
      .08% breath alcohol concentration legal limit), interventions that allow drinkers
      to accurately estimate their BACs, and thus better assess their risk, have
      potential importance to long-term driving-under-the-influence prevention efforts.
      This study describes a field experiment designed to test the impact on drinking
      of providing "Know Your Limit" (KYL) BAC estimation cards to individuals in a
      natural drinking environment. METHOD: We randomly sampled 1,215 U.S. residents as
      they entered Mexico for a night of drinking, interviewed them, and randomly
      assigned them to one of six experimental conditions. Participants were
      reinterviewed and breath-tested when they returned to the United States. The
      experimental conditions included providing generic warnings about drinking and
      driving, giving out gender-specific BAC calculator cards (KYL cards), and
      providing incentives to moderate their drinking. RESULTS: Cueing participants
      about the risks of drunk driving resulted in significantly lower BACs (relative
      to control) for participants who indicated that they would drive home. Providing 
      KYL matrixes did not reduce BACs, and, in fact, some evidence suggests that KYL
      cards undermined the effect of the warning. CONCLUSIONS: KYL information does not
      appear to be an effective tool for reducing drinking and driving. Implications
      for prevention and future research are discussed.

TI  - General hospital admission as an opportunity for smoking-cessation strategies: a 
      clinical trial in Brazil.
PG  - 599-606
LID - 10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2010.09.013 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of 6-month follow-ups for hospitalized patients
      who were divided into two groups of low- and high-intensity treatments for
      smoking cessation and compared to the results of standard hospital treatment.
      METHODS: A total of 2414 patients were screened. Two hundred thirty-seven current
      smokers were randomly assigned to high-intensity intervention (HII; 30-min
      motivational interview plus seven routine telephone calls after hospital
      discharge) or to low-intensity intervention (LII; 15-min counseling about the
      benefits of quitting) and 80 comprised the usual care (UC) group. Six months
      after hospital discharge, all participants were contacted by phone. The main
      outcome measure was smoking cessation. RESULTS: The smoking-cessation rates were 
      44.9%, 41.7% and 26.3% for the HII, LII and UC groups, respectively (P = .03).
      The multivariable analysis identified the following variables which are
      associated with the failure to stop smoking: the absence of a tobacco-related
      disease (TRD), younger age and a low motivation for cessation at the initial
      contact. CONCLUSIONS: There was a great difference between intervention and
      nonintervention. The LII had an impact similar to the HII. The variables
      associated with no smoking cessation demonstrate the need for more personalized
      interventions for smokers who present lower indexes of motivation, are younger
      and do not have smoking-related diseases.

TI  - Brief alcohol interventions for mandated college students: comparison of
      face-to-face counseling and computer-delivered interventions.
PG  - 528-37
LID - 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2010.03193.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: College students who violate alcohol policies are often mandated to
      participate in alcohol-related interventions. This study investigated (i) whether
      such interventions reduced drinking beyond the sanction alone, (ii) whether a
      brief motivational intervention (BMI) was more efficacious than two
      computer-delivered interventions (CDIs) and (iii) whether intervention response
      differed by gender. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with four conditions
      [brief motivation interventions (BMI), Alcohol 101 Plus, Alcohol Edu for
      Sanctions((R)), delayed control] and four assessments (baseline, 1, 6 and 12
      months). SETTING: Private residential university in the United States.
      PARTICIPANTS: Students (n = 677; 64% male) who had violated campus alcohol
      policies and were sanctioned to participate in a risk reduction program.
      MEASUREMENTS: Consumption (drinks per heaviest and typical week, heavy drinking
      frequency, peak and typical blood alcohol concentration), alcohol problems and
      recidivism. FINDINGS: Piecewise latent growth models characterized short-term
      (1-month) and longer-term (1-12 months) change. Female but not male students
      reduced drinking and problems in the control condition. Males reduced drinking
      and problems after all interventions relative to control, but did not maintain
      these gains. Females reduced drinking to a greater extent after a BMI than after 
      either CDI, and maintained reductions relative to baseline across the follow-up
      year. No differences in recidivism were found. CONCLUSIONS: Male and female
      students responded differently to sanctions for alcohol violations and to risk
      reduction interventions. BMIs optimized outcomes for both genders. Male students 
      improved after all interventions, but female students improved less after CDIs
      than after BMI. Intervention effects decayed over time, especially for males.

TI  - Smoking cessation interventions among Hispanics in the United States: A
      systematic review and mini meta-analysis.
PG  - 109-18
LID - 10.4278/ajhp.090123-LIT-25 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The leading causes of mortality among Hispanics living in the United
      States are smoking related. This study sought to systematically review smoking
      cessation interventions targeting healthy Hispanic adults living in the United
      States, to conduct a "mini" meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, and to
      offer recommendations for future research. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified 
      through computerized bibliographic databases (PsychINFO, PsycARTICLES, PsycFirst,
      MEDLINE, Science Direct, and Dissertation Abstracts Online), article reference
      lists, conference abstracts, and unpublished data through October 2008. STUDY
      INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Evaluation of a smoking cessation intervention 
      among healthy U.S. Hispanic adults. Studies included in the meta-analysis were
      also required to be randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION: Twelve studies
      were eligible for the systematic review and five studies for the meta-analysis.
      Two independent raters coded each study. DATA SYNTHESIS: Interventions consisted 
      of self-help, nicotine replacement therapy, and community-based interventions, as
      well as individual, group, and telephone counseling. There was evidence for the
      efficacy of smoking cessation interventions at the end of treatment (odds ratio, 
      1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.16), which was attenuated in the longer
      term. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use among U.S. Hispanics is a growing public health
      concern. Smoking cessation interventions demonstrate promise among Hispanic
      adults living in the United States. More randomized trials evaluating tobacco
      interventions in this special population are warranted, with examination of the
      effect of cultural specificity and acculturation.

TI  - Evaluation of an electronic clinical reminder to facilitate brief
      alcohol-counseling interventions in primary care.
PG  - 720-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Brief intervention for patients with unhealthy alcohol use is a
      prevention priority in the United States, but most eligible patients do not
      receive it. This study evaluated an electronic alcohol-counseling clinical
      reminder at a single Veterans Affairs general medicine clinic. METHOD: The
      systems-level intervention evaluated in this study consisted of making the
      clinical reminder, which facilitated medical record documentation of brief
      intervention among patients who screened positive for unhealthy alcohol use,
      available to providers on one (of two) randomly selected hallways. Secondary
      electronic data were extracted for all patients who visited the clinic (October
      1, 2002, to September 30, 2005). The proportion of patients with
      clinical-reminder use was evaluated among patients who screened positive for
      unhealthy drinking and were assigned to intervention hallway providers
      ("descriptive cohort"). Adjusted logistic regression evaluated the association
      between the intervention and resolution of unhealthy drinking at follow-up among 
      all screen-positive patients who completed a second Alcohol Use Disorders
      Identification Test Consumption questionnaire 18 months or longer after the first
      ("outcomes cohort"). RESULTS: Eligible patients (N= 22,863) included 10,392
      controls and 12,471 in the intervention group. Fifteen percent (398 of 2,640) of 
      descriptive cohort patients with unhealthy drinking had clinical-reminder use,
      which varied by severity (14% [n = 302 of 2,165] with mild/moderate and 20% [n = 
      96 of 475] with severe unhealthy drinking,p = .001). Only 39% (156 of 398) of
      patients with clinical-reminder use had documented brief intervention; advice to 
      abstain was most common. Access to the clinical reminder was not significantly
      associated with resolution of unhealthy drinking in 1,358 patients in the
      outcomes cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of a clinical reminder to facilitate
      brief intervention did not, alone, result in substantial use of the clinical
      reminder. More active implementation efforts may be needed to get brief
      interventions onto the agenda of busy primary care providers.
